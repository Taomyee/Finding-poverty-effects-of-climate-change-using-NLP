GHG emissions of the country and by sectors according to the Figure 3. GHG emissions of the country and by sectors according to the Conditional M&E Monitoring and Evaluation (of climate change adaptation activities) The Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). This is the global legal instrument that stipulates the responsibilities of all Parties concerning climate change response through the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

As a developing country that has just started the process of industrialization over the past three decades and is severely affected by climate change and despite many difficulties in terms of resources, Viet Nam has always proven itself responsible and has proactively implemented international commitments on climate change. Viet Nam submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2015; signed and approved the Paris Agreement, and developed a National Plan for the implementation of the Paris Agreement in 2016. The Law on Environmental Protection (2020) has a chapter on responding to climate change that stipulates the responsibility in GHG emission reduction and climate change adaptation to implement Viet Nams NDC and the Paris Agreement.

Nam, together with other countries, pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 and joined the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use to prevent and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030, and the Adaptation Action Coalition to mobilize resources for climate change adaptation.

The National Steering Committee for Implementing Viet Nams Commitments at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was established on December 21, 2021, headed by the Prime Minister, and has drastically directed the development and implementation of strategies, action programs, plans, and schemes to implement Viet Nams commitment at COP26. Several important documents have been issued by the Government and the Prime Minister, including: Decree on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the ozone layer; National Climate Change Strategy to 2050; the Scheme on Tasks and Solutions to Implement the Results of COP26; Action Program on Green Energy Transition and Reduction of Carbon and Methane Emissions of the Transportation Sector; National Action Plan on Green Growth for the period 2021-2030; Methane Emission Reduction Action Plan to 2030;

Nam, the national monitoring and evaluation system of climate change adaptation activities. The Minister of Natural Resources and Environment has issued a Circular detailing the implementation of the Law on Environmental Protection on climate change response, Decision promulgating the list of emission factors for GHG inventory. Ministries and sectors are continuing to develop and complete legal regulations, circulars, and technical guidelines to reduce GHG emissions, adapt to climate change under their management.

Implementing Decision 1/CP.21 of COP21, Viet Nam completed the review and update of the NDC in 2020 (NDC 2020). Responding to the United Nations Secretary- General Antnio Guterress call, and to manifest Viet Nams efforts as well as determination from COP26 up to now, the country decided to update the NDC once more time. Viet Nam's updated NDC 2022 (NDC 2022) has been formulated based on NDC 2020 and contains new points showcasing the efforts of the country to fulfill the commitments at COP26. The review and update of Viet Nams NDC have been conducted under the instructions of the Prime Minister and with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment taking the lead and active participation of line ministries, experts, scientists, NGOs, research agencies, and development partners through in-person working sessions, and national and sector-level consultation workshops. Official data, valuable experiences, lessons, and studies have been evaluated, analyzed, and utilised.

The contribution to GHG emission reduction in NDC 2022 has significantly increased compared to that in NDC 2020, towards long-term goals identified in Viet Nams National Climate Change Strategy to 2050.

Programs, master plans, plans and projects directly related to GHG emission reduction include: Methane Emission Reduction Action Plan to 2030 (2022); the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Climate Diplomacy Action Plan aiming to implement Viet Nams commitments at COP26 in the period 2022-2025 (2022); Action Program on Green Energy Transition and Reduction of Carbon and Methane Emissions of the Transportation Sector (2022); Action Plan of Construction sector in Climate Change Response for the period 2022-2030, with vision to 2050 in order to implement Viet Nams commitments at COP26 (2022); Action Plan of Ministry of Industry and Trade to implement Viet Nams commitments at COP26 (2022); Environmental Protection Plan for Industry and Trade in the period of 2025-2030 (2020); Regulations on Incentive Mechanism for Solar Power Development in Viet Nam (2020); National Action Program on Sustainable Production and Consumption for the period 2021-2030 (2020); National Program on Economical and Efficient Use of Energy in the period of 2019-2030 (2019); Scheme on Development of Organic Agriculture in the period of 2020 - 2030 (2018); Scheme on Sustainable Forest Management and Forest Certification (2018); Master Plan on Development of Viet Nam's Gas Industry to 2025, orientation to 2035 (2017); Plan for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (2016).

Due to the early implementation of GHG emission reduction measures, Viet Nam has achieved some remarkable results in the energy, transportation, agriculture, LULUCF, waste and industrial processes sectors, specifically as follows: Improving energy efficiency and saving, reducing transmission loss, and strongly developing renewable energy have made significant contributions to reducing GHG emissions in the energy sector. It is estimated that the applied measures on economical and efficient use of energy allowed a reduction of about 67.5 Mt CO2eq in 2020 compared to the BAU. Regarding renewable energy development, by 2020, the total hydropower capacity reached 22,022 MW (of which small hydropower reached 3,674 MW); wind power reached 630 MW; biomass power reached 570 MW; solar power, including rooftop solar power, reached 16,491 MW.

In the transportation sector, the goal of reducing GHG emissions has been integrated in the process of updating, adjusting and developing sector strategies and planning; the Action Program on Green Energy Transition and Reduction of Carbon and Methane Emissions of the Transportation Sector has been implemented, and the use of renewable energy in public lighting and traffic signals has been increased. In the agriculture sector, a wide range of activities to reduce GHG emissions have been carried out. A number of measures to reduce GHG emissions have been applied such as: water withdrawal in the middle of the crop to reduce methane emissions;

In the LULUCF sector, many efforts have been proactively made to reduce GHG emissions and increase carbon sequestration; stabilize the rate of forestation, and improve forest quality. In 2020, there has been a reduction of 11.1 MtCO2eq through activities of increasing planted forest area, protecting natural forests, etc., aiming to achieve the goal of increasing forest cover to 42% by 2030 and maintaining a stable level to 2050.

In the waste sector, many solid waste treatment plants have been built and put into operation with the use of new technologies in waste treatment in combination with compost production, contributing to reducing landfill amounts and limiting environmental impacts. Domestic and industrial wastewater is gradually treated gearing toward the optimization of treatment conditions along with the application of biotechnology or methane recovery solutions to reduce GHG and methane emissions. In the industrial processes sector, solutions to reduce GHG emissions have been applied, including replacing clinker in cement composition; applying advanced technology of chemical and steel industries. In 2020, 4.06 MtCO2eq has been reduced in the sub-sectors of mining industry, construction materials and chemical industry.

With a wide range of activities implemented to reduce GHG emissions in the energy, transportation, agriculture, LULUCF, waste, and industrial processes sectors, Viet Nam obtained relatively great results of GHG emission reduction in the period 2014-2020, and the estimated emission reduction by 2020 was about 85 Mt CO2eq. Increasing education in schools and promoting communication on climate change have encouraged green lifestyles and behaviors, contributing to reducing GHG emissions in the community.

The year of 2014 continues to be used as the base year for emissions under the business-as-usual scenario. This is the year of which the results of the GHG inventory were published in the Third National Communication of Viet Nam sent to the UNFCCC in 2019, and also the base year that Viet Nam used for formulating its iNDC, NDC 2020, the National Climate Change Strategy to 2050, and many other important documents. GHG emission sources/sinks are identified for the energy (including energy in transportation), agriculture, LULUCF, waste, and IP sectors.

The BAU scenario was developed based on the medium economic development scenario, energy demand, GDP growth by sectors, GDP structure by sectors, population growth, forest and forest land planning, and the quantity of livestock and arable land. The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 2000 IPCC Good Practice Guidance have been used to calculate and forecast GHG emissions to 2030. Regarding GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector, the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for the LULUCF sector in 2003 has been used to calculate and forecast GHG emissions/removals to 2030.

The national measures to reduce GHG emission for the period 2021-2030 have been identified for the energy, agriculture, LULUCF, waste, and IP sectors. Criteria for selecting GHG emission reduction measures include: (i) cost/benefit efficiency; (ii) feasibility in implementation; (iii) harmonization and co-benefits with climate change adaptation, socio-economic development; and (iv) consistency with national and sectoral development plans for the period 2021-2030 towards the goals of the National Climate Change Strategy to 2050. Specific measures to reduce GHG emissions include:

- Energy usage: Use of high-efficiency air conditioning and refrigeration equipment in commercial and residential services; use of energy-saving lighting; use of solar water heaters; use of biogas and cleaner fuel instead of coal for household cooking in rural areas; use of measures to improve energy efficiency in industries; use of high- performance electrical equipment, high efficiency refrigeration equipment in services, commerce and trade; improvement, development and application of technology in the production of building materials; efficient use of energy in transportation; limitation of fuel consumption for motor vehicles; conversion of modes of transportation of passengers and goods; increase of the load factor of cars; use of CNG and biofuels; use of electric motorbikes, cars, and buses.

Application of integrated crop management solutions; application of farming technologies such as alternating wet and dry irrigation and SRI in areas with adequate infrastructure; modernization of watering and fertilizing perennial plants; mid-crop or shrimp-rice land; composting and organic agriculture; replacement of nitrogen fertilizers with slow-dissolving and slow-digesting fertilizers; improvement of ruminant rations; circulation of agricultural waste as organic fertilizer; development of using biogas. Measures to reduce methane emissions in sub-sectors of agriculture, especially wet rice farming and management of livestock waste and agricultural by-products are those carried out for the implementation of Viet Nams statement at COP26 so as to reduce methane emission by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.

Protection of existing natural forest areas in mountainous areas, with priority given to hot spots of deforestation and forest degradation; protection of coastal protection forests and special-use forests; restoration of protection forests and special- use forests; improvement of the quality and carbon stock of poor natural forests; improvement of productivity and carbon stock of large timber plantations; scaleup of agroforestry models to improve carbon stocks and conserve soil; sustainable forest management and forest certification. The measures to reduce emissions applied in the LULUCF sector manifest Viet Nams determination to implement the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use.

Implementation of measures to manage and reduce solid waste generation; development and application of solid waste recycling technologies; production of compost and refuse-derived fuel (RDF); recovery, burning and use of methane from solid waste landfills; anaerobic treatment with methane recovery for power generation; optimization of treatment conditions of domestic and industrial wastewater; application of biotechnology to remove methane from domestic wastewater treatment process;

Use of natural mineral additives to replace clinker; use of additives that are waste from the clinker replacement industry; application of the best technologies (improvement of BOF technology) to reduce N2O emissions for the chemical industry; application of the best technologies to reduce emissions in the steel industry; use of climate-friendly refrigerants, and recovery, recycle and destruction of HFCs.

Projections for 2030:

The Unconditional contribution in NDC 2022 has increased significantly compared to that in NDC 2020 in terms of both amount and ratio of emission reduction compared to BAU. Accordingly, the amount of emission reduction in NDC 2022 is 146.3 Mt CO2eq compared to 83.9 Mt CO2eq in NDC 2020 (that of additional reduction is 62.4 Mt CO2eq). The ratio of emission reduction compared to BAU in NDC 2022 is 15.8% compared to 9% in NDC 2020 (that of additional reduction is 6.8% compared to BAU). The Conditional contribution in NDC 2022 has significantly increased compared to that in NDC 2020. Accordingly, the amount of emission reduction in NDC 2022 is 403.7 Mt CO2eq compared to 250.7 Mt CO2eq in NDC 2020 (that of additional reduction is 153.0Mt CO2eq). The ratio of emission reduction compared to BAU in NDC 2022 is 43.5% vs 27.0% in NDC 2020 (that of additional reduction is 16.5% compared to BAU) (Table 4).

Table 3. National contribution to GHG emission reduction by sectors by 2030 Table 4. Comparison of emission reduction targets in NDC 2020 and NDC 2022 National GHG emissions by sectors under the Unconditional contribution are presented in Figure 2.

National GHG emissions by sectors under the Conditional contribution are presented in Figure 3.

Climate change in Viet Nam has continued to develop according to the trends identified in NDC 2020. Climate extremes were recorded with higher intensity and frequency. Between 1958 and 2018, the annual average temperature of the whole country increased by about 0.89oC, an equivalent of 0.15oC/decade; the annual average precipitation of the whole country increased by 2.1%, with the most increase in the South Central Coast and decrease in northern and southern parts of Central Highlands; the number of strong typhoons was on the rise; the number of hot days and droughts increased; the number of cold and freezing cold days decreased; extreme rainfall increased; and average sea levels at monitoring stations increased by 2.74 mm/year, and 3.0 mm/year alone during 1993 - 2018.

According to latest version of Viet Nams Climate Change Scenario 2020 :

- Temperature: Under the medium scenario (RCP4.5), the annual average temperature of the whole country would increase by 1.2-1.7oC by mid-century and by 1.6-2.4oC by the end of the century. Under the high scenario (RCP8.5), annual average temperature would increase by 1.7-2.3oC by mid-century and 3.2-4.2oC by the end of the century. The temperature in the North would increase higher than that in the South.

Extreme temperatures are likely to increase.

- Rainfall: Under the medium scenario, annual rainfall would generally increase by 10-15% by mid-century and 10-20% by the end of the century. Under the high scenario, annual rainfall would increase by 10-15% by mid-century and 10-25% by the end of the century; some regions in the Northeast might witness an increase of over 40%. The average one-day maximum rainfall would rise across the country (10-70%) compared to the base period (1986-2005).

- Extreme weather/climate events: The number of strong to very strong typhoons would increase. The summer monsoon would start earlier and end later. The number of severely cold days in Northern provinces would decrease. The number of hot days would increase. Droughts would be harsher.

- Sea level rise and flooding risks due to sea level rise: Under the high scenario, by the end of the century, the average sea level along the entire coastline could increase by 73 cm (49103 cm). If the sea level rises by 100cm, risks of permanent flooding (% of areas) of areas are as follows: 47.3% in the Mekong River Delta, 13.2% in the Red River Delta; 1.9% in Quang Ninh province; 1.5% in Central coastal provinces; 17.2% in Ho Chi Minh City; 4.8% in Ba Ria - Vung Tau province.

Viet Nam is regarded as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Increased exposure to climate change is the main cause of increased economic losses from natural disasters. With a coastline of 3,260 km and islands, Viet Nam will face the risk of climate change and sea level rise. Delta and coastal regions, especially coastal cities with high population densities that havent integrated climate change in urban and spatial planning will face increased risks.

The Northern mountainous and the Central regions are threatened by the risk of flash floods and landslides. The Central Coastal and Central Southern regions, the Red River Delta and the Central Highlands face the risks of droughts, water shortages and increased desertification. The Mekong Delta is at risk of flooding due to sea level rise, land subsidence and saline intrusion.

The poor, ethnic minority groups, people whose livelihoods depend on the climate, and the elderly, women, children, and people with chronic illnesses are those with the highest level of vulnerability.

Agriculture, biodiversity, water resources, public health, residential areas, and physical infrastructure are highly vulnerable due to their high exposure and sensitivity to natural disasters and extreme weather events. Climate change is an existential threat to the goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development. Loss and damage caused by climate change in some regions may reverse long-term gains.

Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events leads to increased risks for regions, sectors and people. Due to the impact of climate change and sea level water for domestic and industrial purposes contaminated with saltwater, peoples lives are seriously affected.

- Water resources: In recent years, water flows of main river basins have been lower than the average for many years. Water flows in the dry season decrease, the water levels reach historic lows in many places, droughts and water shortages happen more frequently, and saline intrusion extends further into the mainland. Under climate change scenarios, in most river basins, flows during the flood season tend to increase; high and extreme floods occur with higher frequency and severity.

- Land resources: Prolonged heat and droughts increase the risk of arid soil, reducing soil quality. Increased droughts during the dry season and increased rainfall during the rainy season cause a rise in erosion and landslides in riverside and upland areas. Flooding due to sea level rise is one of the major threats to land resources of the delta and coastal areas.

- Forest resources: Increased heat will increase the risk of forest fires. Rising temperature, high humidity, heavy rain, strong wind, degraded land, and other factors create favorable conditions for pests and insects to grow and spread, severely affecting the conservation and development of forest ecosystems. Reduced area due to forest fires, pests and diseases, as well as changes in the growth and development of forest ecosystems will affect the output and value of forest products.

- Sea and island resources: Rising sea temperature changes the growing season, increasing the outbreak of phytoplankton, which is detrimental to the growth of seagrasses. Climate change increases ocean acidification; strong storms destroy coral reefs, grasslands, give rise to species modification, and decrease marine fish resources.

The islands and island groups will bear the brunt of climate change impact. - Mineral resources: Rising sea level may cause soil, rock and ore to be inundated, contaminated with salt and alum, increasing mining and processing costs.

Climate change may also facilitate the formation of new ore bodies. Some types of heavy minerals found in solid rocks (gemstones, gold, titanium, etc.) can easily accumulate over time and form placer deposits and weathered mines.

- Biodiversity: Climate change and sea level rise can change the structure and distribution of species and biodiversity of ecosystems. Rising temperature will change the distribution and structure of biomes. Sea level rise and increased storm intensity change the composition of sediments, salinity, and pollute water, degrade and threaten mangroves and species.

- Cultivation: Viet Nams rice and corn yields could decline by 8.8% and 18.7% in 2030, and 15.1% and 32.9% in 2050 respectively. If the sea level rises by 100cm, 32.2% of agricultural land is at risk of flooding. Under the climate change scenario, if rice yield and cultivation area remain unchanged with no adaptation measures, Viet Nam will run the risk of losing 21.4% of rice production by 2100.

- Husbandry: Impacts of climate change on husbandry include changes in the production and quality of animal feed, and increase in disease outbreaks. Pig farming is expected to decrease by about 8.2% in terms of headcount.

- Forestry: Climate change and extreme weather events will increase the risk of forest fires, especially in the Northwest, North Central and Central Highlands; affect the distribution of biodiversity in sensitive forests such as dipterocarp forests, mangroves, evergreen broadleaf forests; increase the risk of developing forest pests and diseases; of biodiversity loss, especially for species with narrow ecological distribution. - Aquaculture: Saline intrusion will significantly reduce areas of freshwater aquaculture, affecting the ecological environment, and changing biodiversity.

Storms and heavy rains cause flooding and erosion, damaging traffic works and equipment in ports and wharves; sea level rise and spring tide may cause flooding of aviation activities; saline intrusion causes structural corrosion and damage equipment. The roadways sector is heavily affected by climate change, followed by railways and inland waterways. The maritime and aviation sectors are insignificantly affected. Mountainous areas in the North, Central Coast and Central Highlands are at risk of erosion and landslides. The Red River Delta and the Mekong River Delta regions are at risk of flooding due to sea level rise. Central coastal provinces face risks of inundation and erosion caused by rain and floods. All of these risks have an impact on transport infrastructure.

Sea level rise may cause the inundation of metropolises such as Ho Chi Minh City as well as cities in the Mekong River Delta and along the Central Coastal regions. Municipalities in the Northern mountainous, hilly region and the Central regions are often affected by extreme rain and post-storm circulation, causing floods, flash floods and landslides. Climate change also affects water resources and water supply systems.

Climate change has direct impacts on tourism resources, infrastructure and travel activities. Tourism service facilities, accommodations and entertainment facilities are damaged or degraded under the impact of typhoons and floods. Climate change also energy, water management, and land-use, etc.

Climate change will adversely affect human health, especially that of the elderly, women, children, and people with chronic illnesses. According to statistics, an average temperature increase of 1C results in a 3.8% increase of hospitalisation rate for children aged under 5 due to respiratory infections. Climate change facilitates the development of vector-borne diseases, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and spread of diseases, such as influenza A, diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, typhoid, viral encephalitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, plague, and zika.

- Industry: Rising temperatures lead to increases in energy consumption in industries as well as costs of ventilation and cooling for mines and reduce the efficiency and output of power plants. Rain, storms and sea level rise will affect the operating process, increasing the cost of maintenance and repair works; affect the supply and consumption of energy; increase the risk of inundation in industrial zones. If the sea level rises by about 100 cm, most coastal industrial zones will suffer from flooding of between 10% and 67% of their total areas.

- Energy: Increased temperatures increase the energy demand due to the use of cooling equipment. Unusual rainfall and water flows affect the supply capacity and production plan of hydroelectricity, damage the electricity supply infrastructure, increase the cost of new investment, renovation, repair and upgrading of equipment and electricity distribution network. Sea level rise has negative impacts on power plants, power transmission systems, substations, fuel systems, mines, coal yards and other energy-related facilities in coastal areas.

- Trade: Climate change can affect commercial infrastructure through local flooding, impacting the storage and circulation of goods. Sea level rise will affect seaports, river ports as well as trade and logistics centres in coastal areas. Different climate change responses in different countries could also affect global, regional and domestic trade.

- Delta areas: The delta areas will face risks of inundation due to sea level rise. Increased saline intrusion and droughts bear serious impacts on freshwater supply, reducing water quality; rice yield may decrease between 8% and 15% by 2030, and possibly 30% by 2050. Other threats are also on the rise, such as lack of water for domestic use, negative effects on the aquaculture and fishing environments, increased crop diseases, degradation of soil, and the loss of biodiversity and rare genetic resources. - Coastal areas: Coastal areas of Viet Nam are severely affected by sea level rise and such climate-related hazards as typhoons and tropical depressions, floods, and landslides. Sea level rise will increase the risk of inundation in coastal areas. Climate change accelerates soil degradation processes, increases saline intrusion area, reduces rice production and creates many other environmental consequences; degrades biodiversity in coastal areas, changes the ecosystems of lowland areas; shrinks the area of forests and natural vegetation.

- Mountainous areas: Rising temperatures will affect agriculture, biodiversity, energy production and consumption, and public health. Floods will affect agriculture, water resources, transportation, peoples health and lives. The heavily affected groups are mainly people in mountainous areas, especially ethnic minorities and the elderly, women and children. Under the impact of heavy rains caused climate change, the intensity of flash floods tends to increase, causing greater impacts on peoples lives.

- Women: Rising temperatures, prolonged heatwaves, and droughts increase stress, pressure and anxiety in households, which can lead to violence against women.

Climate and temperature related illnesses are increasing in frequency, which poses significant challenges to maternal health.

- Ethnic minorities: Climate change is one of the major causes leading to an increase in poverty and falling back into poverty among ethnic minorities. Ethnic minority groups, who heavily rely on natural resources, have limited adaptive capacity as well as access to markets and financial services for post-disaster adaptation and recovery, putting them at risk of sinking deeper into poverty, and being unable to develop.

- Children and adolescents: Rising temperatures, prolonged heatwaves and droughts increase diseases in children and adolescents. An increase in the number of hot days will affect childrens ability to concentrate and study, as well as the teaching capacity of teachers. Floods affect childrens opportunities to access education due to loss of livelihood, which may result in dropping out of school and exposure to environmental hazards and damaged infrastructure after natural disasters. - The elderly: Viet Nam is one of the fastest aging countries in the world. The migration of young couples in pursuit of better economic opportunity often translates preventing them from accessing nonagricultural job opportunities".

- People with disabilities: Climate change has a strong impact on people with disabilities due to their high levels of vulnerability, limited ability to take adaptation actions and participate in adaptation planning. This group also faces higher risk in case of emergency relocation. Damage and disruption to health care services can lead to a decline in their wellness and an increased risk of other diseases.

(equivalent to 0.8% of GDP) due to extreme weather events. Moreover, taking into account the overall costs of environmental degradation, for 2020, climate-induced losses are estimated to be at around USD 10 billion, equivalent to 3.2% of GDP. In 2011, 2012, 2018 and 2020, there were 5,929 classrooms and functional buildings destroyed and damaged, and 2,723 school sites affected. More than 204,000 hectares of forest were damaged in 2012, 2018, and between 2020 and 2021.

Between 2011 and 2020, 2,153 people died, 316 people went missing, and 4,117 people were injured due to natural disasters. Post-disaster losses also include disease outbreaks caused by contaminated drinking water and mental health problems caused by trauma, anxiety, and stress. Climate change is also one of the reasons for increasing migration and forcing tens of thousands of households to permanently relocate, risking the loss of cultural identity and local knowledge.

Viet Nam's growth. Without effective adaptation measures, a temperature increase of 1.00C and 1.50C could cause losses of about 1.8% of GDP and 4.5% of GDP respectively; as well as economic losses of about USD 4.3 billion in the next 10 years.

If the sea level rises and temperature increases as in the worst case scenario, it is estimated that 3.1 million Vietnamese people will have to migrate internally by 2050. Under the high climate change scenario, the flood risk level of urban areas is induced storms and floods in the Mekong River Delta will be at USD 2.1 billion, an increase of 11% compared to current level. Increased rainfall can create risks of landslides and flooding for about 20% of the total length of the national highway network, and 20% of the total length of the railway network. If the sea level rises by 100 cm, about 4% of the railway system, over 9% of the national highway system and about 12% of the provincial roadway system would be affected. Disruption of railway lines can lead to economic losses of USD 2.3-2.6 million/day. Rising sea levels could cost agriculture USD 43 billion. The Mekong Delta is the area that suffers the most, followed by the Red River Delta. About 1.1 million tons of farmed aquaculture, or USD 935 cm, then 78 out of 286 critical natural habitats (27%), 46 conservation areas (33%), 9 biodiversity areas of national and international importance (23%) and 23 other biodiversity areas will be severely impacted. The majority of the coastal industrial zones be eroded; 42% of coastal hotels are located near landslide areas; and 2/3 of the dike system (over 2,659 km) may not meet safety standards.

In addition to the already identified economic losses, Viet Nam is also at a high risk of non-economic losses, which include loss of human lives, negative impacts on peoples health or loss of opportunities due to the relocation of economic zones. Non- economic losses also include loss of land due to erosion, loss of cultural heritage and local knowledge, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Viet Nam has issued and implemented many guidelines, policies, strategies, programs and plans in its efforts to respond to climate change and implement international commitments, specifically:

Between 2011 and 2021, the Government has issued a number of policies to secure public finance for climate change response. Financial resources for climate change adaptation are mobilized from Viet Nams public spending, official development aids, and investment from Viet Nams socio-professional and mass organizations, international non-governmental organizations (usually at the local level). Viet Nam has made progress in mobilizing investment for climate change adaptation, promoting economic growth while protecting natural resources and the environment. The positive trend in mobilizing finance for climate change adaptation is reflected in the higher proportion of domestic capital than ODA, in addition, the private sectors financial resources tend to increase gradually over the period of time.

- Climate change response community was established but is still siloed and small-scale; development and diversification of livelihoods in response to climate change still face many difficulties. Some models of livelihood transformation with good results have not been replicated; local knowledge on adapting to climate change has not been researched, evaluated and guided for preservation and promotion.

- The public health care system has been upgraded but remains incapable in responding to climate change, especially for diseases that are negatively impacted by extreme climate. There is no monitoring, early warning and forecasting system for the impacts of climate change on health.

- There is an overall lack of regulations, incentive mechanisms and solutions to improve the role and position of women in policy formulation and implementation of climate change response and natural disaster prevention activities at all levels. 3.3.2. Adaptive capacity to increasingly extreme climate and disaster due to - The monitoring system for climate change and sea level rise has not been connected to the global and regional systems; the system of hydro-meteorological and oceanographic forecasting and warning. Forecasting and warning of natural disasters still have some floods, landslides, thunderstorms, whirlwinds, hail and fog at sea.

- The investment and construction of key works to respond to natural disasters, such as river dikes, sea dikes, reservoirs, shelters for ships, and landslide prevention have yet to meet the requirements; Investigation and mapping of landslide hazard warning zones (at commune level), and mapping of rockslide warning zones are slow. - Migration in high-risk areas is carried out slowly due to financial difficulties; community resilience to climate change and disaster prevention models, and climate resilient livelihood models have not been replicated; solutions to improve adaptive and disaster prevention capacity at community level are still limited.

3.3.3. Refining institutions, promoting potentials and resources for effective - Many legal documents have mentioned climate change adaptation but there is an overall lack of guiding documents, such as a mechanism for sharing information and data on climate change among state agencies; prioritization of climate change adaptation activities of all sectors; integration of gender equality in climate change adaptation. - Human resources with expertise in climate change in some ministries, sectors and localities are still lacking as most personnel are part-time or transferred from other fields and do not have appropriate professional qualifications; awareness on climate change of officials and people is not adequate with the rapid and increasing evolution and impact of climate change.

- State resources are able to meet 30% of adaptation needs; investment in climate change adaptation and disaster prevention needs to be increased.

- Scientific research information has not been widely disseminated; there is an overall lack of comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, user-oriented studies, studies supporting climate change adaptation and forecast; there is a lack of research and data to provide a scientific basis to support state management, refining the legal system and legislation on climate change.

- The integration of climate change into strategic planning has been emphasized but without many specific results.

- The coordination between ministries as well as between ministries, sectors and local authorities in climate change adaptation activities is still limited. - There is not yet a rigorous mechanism to coordinate stakeholders in the development and implementation of regional plans. The impact of climate change on the whole region has not been considered, leading to the implementation of adaptation activities for one area that may increase risks for other areas in the region and across multiple regions.

- The participation of women and young people in climate change adaptation activities is still limited.

- Understanding of international treaties on climate change, especially at the local, business, private and community levels is still low; some contents in current legal documents do not really support or match international requirements.

Viet Nam defines the goal of climate change adaptation as reducing vulnerability and risk to the negative impacts of climate change through improving the resilience and adaptive capacity of the natural, economic and social systems, reducing loss and damage caused by natural disasters, increasingly extreme climate events and sea level rise due to climate change; promoting the integration of climate change adaptation into the system of strategic planning.

There is a correlation between measures for GHG emission reduction and climate change adaptation, and they are also linked with national socio-economic development. GHG emission reduction measures can be beneficial but can also act as barriers to climate change adaptation. Similarly, GHG emission reduction and climate change adaptation can both be beneficial but can also negatively affect socio-economic development. Synergy and co-benefit in NDC implementation is one of the criteria to define prioritized goals and actions, thus support to identification of measures to maximize benefits and mitigate negative effects.

Measures for emission reduction can offer economic, social, environmental benefits and support the implementation of other policies. Greenhouse gas emission reduction can also benefit climate change adaptation activities and vice versa. In which, measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have a higher contribution to climate change adaptation than climate change adaptation actions to greenhouse gas emission reduction.

Measures for emission reduction in the LULUCF, energy and industrial processes sectors have higher co-benefit potentials for socio-economic development than those in agricultural and waste sectors.

In the energy sector, measures for supply side and some for consumption side such as to use biofuels, electric vehicles and high efficiency electrical equipment in commercial services are assessed to be deliver co-benefits with socio-economic development at high to very high level. Measures in the LULUCF sector all synergize and co-benefit with socio-economic development at high level. In the industrial processes sector, a measure that benefits socio-economic development at a high level is using climate-friendly refrigerants. In the waste sector, measures for emission reduction that co-benefit with socio-economic development at a high level are solid waste reduction and refuse derived fuel (RDF) production.

Emissions reduction actions in the LULUCF sector that boasts a very high rating for adaptation benefits, mainly through activities in forest protection, afforestation, reforestation and sustainable forest management, contributing to improving the adaptive capacity of the community, helping to creating jobs and increasing peoples income. The agricultural, industrial processes and energy sectors contributions to community resilience are rated at high level, while for waste sector, it is rated as medium. Measures that are rated as having very high synergy include: Measures related to applying best technology to reduce emissions for the chemical industry, steel industry and using friendly refrigerants with climate (industrial processes); measures related to crop and livestock restructuring, organic farming practices (agricultural field); developing biogas to replace coal for cooking in rural areas; heating in steel mills; spraying anthracite powder into blast furnaces, and energy supply side measures (energy sector).

Aspects that climate change adaptation measures can bring the largest synergy and co-benefit are in institutions and policies, followed by society and the economy. Different groups of measures from various industries/sectors contribute differently to the development, with adaptation in the agriculture and food security sector providing the greatest benefits.

Adapting to climate change creates prerequisites to ensure social stability and economic development so that more emission reductions can be realized. Climate change adaptation benefits emissions reductions in terms of emission intensity reductions. Each climate change adaptation measure in each sector has a different contribution to emission reduction. In which, in the field of forest and ecosystem management, there are groups of measures with the greatest beneficial potential: managing forest resources in association with biodiversity conservation and improving ecosystem services; strengthening the protection capacity of watershed forests and coastal forests. Followed behind are the measures on ensuring social security and gender equality, in which there are groups of measures on the development of sustainable livelihood models, nature-based, ecosystem-based and community-based adaptation models.

4.2. Synergy between climate change response and sustainable development The implementation of climate change response measures in NDC 2022 will contribute to the achievement of Viet Nams sustainable development goals. Climate change adaptation measures have the highest contribution to Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts and Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Emission reduction measures potentially bring great benefits in increasing employment opportunities, improving environmental protection and public health, all of which have the highest contribution to Goal 03: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, Goal 08:

Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all, Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, Goal 13, and Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. In particular, the highest contributions are given to Goal 03 and Goal 13.

Other ministries and ministerial-level agencies are responsible for providing activity data and relevant information for measurement, reporting, and verification of GHG emission reduction at national and sectoral levels upon the request of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; coordinate with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and other line ministries to inspect the compliance with regulations on measurement, reporting, and verification of GHG emission reductions within the scope of management.

- At national level: The tasks in the NDC are reviewed and evaluated at the national level every two years. Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is the focal point for monitoring and evaluation at national level, responsible for leading and coordinating with ministries, ministerial-level agencies, and provincial-level Peoples Committees in monitoring and evaluating the implementation of NDC; develop and operate a national online database on measurement, reporting, and verification of GHG emission reductions; synthesize and develop monitoring and evaluation reports for governmental management of climate change and reports as regulated by UNFCCC; update, implement NDC, Biennial Transparency Report and other national reports on climate change and ozone layer protection in accordance with the provisions of international treaties to which the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a signatory.

5.4.2. Monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation targets The monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation targets is conducted through the M&E system for adaptation activities, regulated in the Prime Ministers Decision No. 148/QD-TTg dated January 28, 2022. Specifically:

Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is the focal agency of the M&E system, responsible for leading and cooperating with Ministries, Ministry-level agencies, and provincial Peoples Committees to develop the M&E system; organizing a 5 year holistic assessment of climate change adaptation activities; synthesizing and developing M&E reports for governmental management of climate change.

Ministries, Ministry-level agencies, and provincial Peoples Committees are responsible for conducting M&E of climate change adaptation activities under their scope of management; updating the progress and results of climate change adaptation activities to the M&E database; reporting on synthesized monitoring results through the online system according to instructions from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.

The monitoring and evaluation of resources mobilization for climate change response is carried out under Viet Nams regulations. The capital from the state budget is monitored and evaluated according to the Law on State Budget. The monitoring and evaluation of resources mobilized from organizations, individuals, domestic and foreign enterprises for implementing the NDC shall comply with relevant legal regulations to ensure efficiency for resources and targets of climate change adaptation and GHG emission reduction.

Responding to climate change and protecting the Earths climate system for the present and future generations has become a prioritised action and cooperation criteria for most countries, international organisations, and businesses, and grown into a widely- spread ideal and lifestyle worldwide. This has positively contributed to the promotion of climate change responses in Viet Nam. Proactive response to climate change is one of the issues that has received considerable attention from Viet Nams political system and its international development partners. One of the international objectives of the Paris Agreement is to align financial flow with a climate-resilient and low-emissions development pathway; therefore, international resources to support NDC implementation may increase over time. As a country responsible and proactive in the implementation of its international commitments as well as efficient in the use of supporting resources, Viet Nam has the opportunity to attract international support for its climate change responses.

The GHG emission reduction measures in the NDC are consistent with the guidelines of the Party and the State, facilitating a good prospect of attracting domestic and international investment. Adaptation measures in the NDC are both urgent and long- and in the disaster prevention and control plans of ministries, sectors and localities, based on climate change scenarios in Viet Nam. Significant achievements have been made in education, healthcare and social welfare, all contributing to raising peoples awareness and capacity to adapt to natural disasters and climate change. These are the As a developing country bearing heavy impacts from natural disasters and highly vulnerable to climate change, Viet Nam has considerable challenges in implementing the NDC. The challenges are as follows:

- Responding to climate change requires determination and efforts from every country. Countries with different natural, political, economic, social conditions, scientific and technological levels, and past contribution to GHG emissions should take different actions and set different priorities. The consolidation of global efforts often takes time and may negatively affect the strategies and efforts to respond to climate change in Viet Nam.

- Regarding resources: Implementation of NDC requires significant financial, technological and human resources, which will certainly affect the implementation of other socioeconomic development objectives of the country, in the context that the country does not have enough economic potential to meet the needs. In order to implement unconditional contribution and reduce GHG emissions by 15.8% by 2030 compared to BAU, Viet Nams incremental financing needs are USD 21.7 billion. The financing needs for climate change adaptation in 2030 is estimated to be over 3 - 5% of 2020 GDP. It is estimated that the financing needs for the period of 2021-2030 will be USD 54.99 - 91.65 billion by the 2020 net present value at a discount rate of 10%. If Viet Nam continues to implement the current plan to spend 1.5% of GDP on climate change adaptation, on average, it needs to mobilize extra-budget capital of about USD 2.75 - 6.42 billion, or about USD 27.5 - 64.16 billion in the 2021-2030 period. Therefore, along with mobilizing resources, attracting investment from domestic economic sectors along with international financial and technological support is essential in reducing GHG emissions and implementing climate change adaptation activities.

- Regarding climate change adaptation: Facilities and infrastructure systems for effective natural disaster prevention and control as well as for climate change adaptation are in dire need of upgrading. Currently, only about 30% of sea dike upgrading works and 36.5% of reservoirs have been repaired as planned. There has been a lack of storm shelters and effective flood prevention works. The protection, restoration and planting of mangroves and coastal protection forests have only achieved about 30% of the plan set out by 2020. Flooding from heavy rain and high tide has not been significantly addressed, especially in the delta and coastal areas, large urban areas, which are densely populated and have numerous production activities. The most pressing tasks are to strengthen infrastructure, protect resources and ecosystems, ensure livelihoods and peoples safety, and adapt to climate change. The capacity for natural disasters forecasting and warning remains limited, particularly in regards to unusual and irregular developments of extreme weather conditions. Disaster prevention and control activities are primarily focused on response and recovery after natural disasters, with insufficient resources for prevention; search and rescue operations continue to lack specialized equipment and professional personnel. The majority of existing climate change adaptation solutions focus on structural solutions rather than non-structural and soft solutions. The insurance market has been formed in recent years but has not been fully developed, especially the natural disaster risk and climate change insurances.

- Regarding GHG emission reduction: The goal of ensuring national energy security still faces many challenges: the domestic fuel supply is insufficient to meet demand; imported fuel sources are heavily reliant on geopolitical factors and price fluctuations, particularly LNG fuel to boost gas power and replace coal power. The competitive energy market has not developed synchronously, with insufficient energy price policy as well as limited awareness and action on energy conservation, renewable energy development and utilization. In order to achieve the goal of low GHG emissions, Viet Nam needs to rapidly reduce the use of fossil energy, especially coal-fired power, and shift to the use of renewable energy sources and low emission technologies, however these technologies are still expensive or incomplete (such as CCUS, hydrogen, etc.). The cost of solar and wind energies have decreased rapidly in recent times but are not stable due to their dependence on the weather and daylight. The power grid for integrating and transmitting renewable energy sources has lagged behind the rate of source construction, limiting the systems output of clean electricity and posing risks to investors. The initial investment capital for GHG emission reduction is high while the market for energy-saving technologies and renewable energy remains limited. As for power supply, the need to invest in nearly 24,000 MW turbines that will run on imported LNG for more than 8 years is a major challenge with limited feasibility. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, many businesses are short on resources and are reluctant to invest in low-emissions technologies.

- Regarding the completion of institutions, promoting potentials and resources for effective response to climate change: the legal system, mechanisms, and policies on GHG emission reduction and climate change adaptation have been formed but remain incomplete as this is a new field, with limited practical experiences in formulation and implementation. Although the MRV system for GHG emissions reduction and the M&E system for climate adaptation at national level are available, it takes time to adjust and strengthen the capacity of operating staff in order to operate smoothly. MRV and M&E systems at sectoral and local levels are still lacking. Although technology standards and equipment labeling regulations are currently in effect, implementation is still slow.

6.2.1. Support in policy development, policy improvement and capacity building - Policy development and improvement on climate change: Complete institutions and legal regulations related to climate change response, policies on insurance, climate risk sharing; integrate content of responding to climate change into strategies and plans; improve the management system in the energy transition, including the organizational structure; attract and manage international financial resources; encourage private investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy development; ensure just transition, including supporting people who lose jobs and creating new jobs, assist low- income groups when energy prices are high, and protecte womens rights; assist small and medium enterprises, farming households, and fishing households in increasing energy efficiency and conversion; innovate the energy sector toward competitive wholesale and retail energy markets; develop national standards and industry-specific technical guidelines to reduce GHG emissions and improve the resilience and adaptive capacity of natural, economic, and social systems.

- Personnel training: Train state managers at all levels on climate change planning, implementation, M&E for climate change adaptation, GHG inventory, and MRV for GHG emission reduction; train highly qualified scientific and technical staff in the fields of emission reduction and climate change adaptation; and train staff in dealing with loss and damage caused by climate change.

6.2.3. Support in climate change adaptation:

- Improve forecasting and early warning capacity: Forecast and warn natural disasters and climate extremes; develop quantitative rain forecasting technologies; warn and forecast flash floods and landslides; impact-based forecast; forecast diseases for plants and animals in the context of climate change; monitor, forecast, and warn the impact of climate change on health and new diseases caused by climate change. - Improve resilience and safety against disasters exacerbated by climate change: Plant and protect forests with a focus on watershed protection forests, mangroves , and coastal protection forests; conserve biodiversity and ecosystems with a focus on developing marine and coastal conservation zones; develop adaptive models based on nature and ecosystems that ensure sustainable livelihoods for people; upgrade and ensure safety from natural disasters exacerbated by climate change for lakes, dams, river, and sea dikes systems; build and upgrade stormproof boat anchorages; implement anti-flooding measures for major cities, particularly Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Can Tho; build safe houses against storms and floods for people in high-risk areas; enhance search, rescue, and relief equipment.

- Assist Viet Nam in strengthening its research and development (R&D) capacity in order to achieve scientific and technological autonomy in climate change response and energy transition.

- GHG emission reduction technologies: Research on technologies and solutions to reduce methane leakage in fossil fuel extraction (coal, oil, gas); develop stored hydroelectricity, energy storage batteries, mechanical energy storage and heat storage; and technology to increase the flexibility of thermal power sources to operate more efficiently with renewable energy sources; increase the local content in energy equipment; develop the production of green hydrogen and ammonia fuels for use in power generation, industries and transportation. Apply mixed fuel combustion technologies (biomass or ammonia and coal; hydrogen and natural gas). Capture, use and storage carbon from coal power plants and heavy industry facilities; recover, recycle and destroy HFCs.

- Technologies for climate change adaptation: Research on addressing loss and damages caused by climate change. Research and conduct technological transfer to develop climate-smart agriculture; varieties of plants and animals adapting to climate change; technologies for preventing riverbank and coastal erosion; economical and efficient use of water; combat degradation, water pollution; and develop smart buildings, smart cities to adapt to climate change; forest fire prevention.

With national resources together with the cooperation and support of the international community, particularly from developed countries, in forms of finance, capacity building, and technology transfer, including implementation of mechanisms under the Paris Agreement, Viet Nam is mobilizing the efforts of the entire political system, businesses, people, and society to fulfill the contributions stated in NDC, contributing to the protection of the Earths climate system. However, the outcome of Viet Nam's NDC implementation is contingent on the following factors:

- Viet Nams GHG inventory system has gradually improved, including the of GHG emission estimates, but there are still significant drawbacks. As Viet Nam's GHG inventory system improves, recalculations may lead to changes in previously reported GHG emission. In addition, the calculation of GHG emissions and reduction in some measures rely on subjective assumptions.

- The 1.50C objective of the Paris Agreement requires common global effort. Viet Nams effort towards GHG emission reduction and the net-zero target will become less meaningful without the joint efforts of the international community. When global targets cannot be achieved, Viet Nam may have to review its emissions reduction efforts. - The global climate finance objectives and the extent to which these objectives will be achieved remain uncertain. So far, the target of mobilizing USD 100 billion per year by 2020 has not been met, despite being very low in comparison to the need to climate change response in developing countries. The global financial objectives to 2025 and 2030 have not yet been determined. As a result, developing countries, including Viet Nam, run the risk of not receiving international support to implement measures to adapt to climate change and reduce GHG emissions. In addition, the regulations on procedures have slowed down the access to global climate finance, particularly for vulnerable populations with limited capacity.

- The implementation of some measures to reduce GHG emissions is dependent on the technology transfer process and the rate at which green technologies reach market maturity. On the other hand, Viet Nam may lose more resources to deal with the consequences of other countries implementation of climate change mitigation measures that have a negative impact on Viet Nam, resources that could have been used to carry out the NDC.

- Large investments in GHG emission reduction can jeopardize the urgent and critical goal of climate change adaptation due to limited resources from the budget and lower-than-expected investment from businesses and individuals. In that case, it may be necessary to divert resources from sources that are expected to be spent on implementing the NDCs unconditional contributions on GHG emission reductions to climate change adaptation activities./.
