Mozambique developed the BAU scenario based on the sum of mitigation actions for the period 2020 to 2025, proposing expectations for annual emission reductions.

Finally, Mozambique proposes to carry out a series of mitigation actions that in aggregate expect to achieve a reduction of GHG emissions by about 40 million tCO2 eq between 2020 not to include as part of the mitigation contribution of this updated NDC 1 the removals and emissions from the commercial-scale tree planting (afforestation) component, due to the uncertainties of how such emissions and any emission reductions achieved by the activities of this component will be accounted for under the Paris Agreement. Mozambique reserves the right to apply this paragraph in the future, including to adjust the information contained in item 1b) above.

With the implementation of the identified actions, measures, projects, policies and programmes, Mozambique expects to reduce its GHG emissions by about 40 Mt CO2eq between 2020 and 2025. The indicators are the tons of CO2eq reduced following the baseline parameters and mitigation actions calculated by measures and accounted in annual results, which will be aggregated and compared to the quantities committed in 2025.

2. DEADLINES AND / OR PERIODS OF APPLICATION:

3. SCOPE AND COVERAGE:

The reference period for operationalization is from 2020 to 2025, so the mitigation results should be achieved by the year 2025.

The emission reduction target presented by Mozambique is divided into cumulative annual efforts between the years 2020 and 2025, whereby the country commits to reduce its emissions by about 40 MtCO2eq between 2020 and 2025. The country expects to reduce these emissions in comparison to the BAU of the specific actions and, should Mozambique benefit from international climate finance, the total investment required to generate these reductions and the other actions foreseen in this updated NDC 1 is estimated to be around USD 7.586 billion (from 2020 to 2025).

(a) General description of the target;

Sectors: The scope of the contribution covers the sectors of the national economy relevant for GHG emissions in the actions listed in item 1b above.

The sectors covered are those that cover the mitigation actions listed in item 1.b.

Mozambique has not yet conducted mitigation co-benefit assessments for economic diversification plans.

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines;

4. PLANNING PROCESSES:

AFollowing the ratification of the Paris Agreement by Parliament in 2017, the then Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development submitted to Cames Institute for Cooperation and Language of Portugal the project "Roadmap for the Implementation of Mozambique's Nationally Determined Contribution - NDCMoz "with the aim of designing the roadmap for the implementation of Mozambique's NDC, contributing to the implementation and success of the Paris Agreement, through a country with a low carbon and resilient development the Government to prioritize the operationalization of Mozambique's NDC targets in the sectors of: agriculture, energy, water, transport and early warning system, aligning them with government policies and priorities.

These two initiatives were harmonised to cover all sectors of the Mozambique NDC 2020 - 2030, and enabled a broad consultation process with stakeholders, including business sectors, resulted in the formulation of the Mozambique NDC 2020 - 2025, the Mozambique NDC Operationalisation Plan 2020 - 2025, which details the actions of the NDC. On the other hand, needs for the implementation of NDC.

These documents were approved by the Council of Ministers at its 38th Session, held on 11 December 2018. However, some actions of the Mozambique NDC 2020 -2025 and the respective Mozambique NDC Operationalization Plan 2020 - 2025 lacked relevant information for the process of measuring/monitoring, reporting and verifying both the actions and the support. On the other hand, there was a need to have updated inventories, as the estimated contributions in NDC 1 were based on the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report 1995 - 2004. its NDC to the Transparency Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines. Under this support it was possible, amongst other results, to update the NDC budget and identify actions whose implementation is conditioned to international climate support and those that are not conditioned; formulate project ideas for priority actions conditioned to international climate support; formulate Mozambique's Long Term Low Carbon Development Strategy 2020 - 2050; update energy sector statistics; integrate NDC into planning and budgeting processes; detail NDC actions; formulate National Adaptation Plan for the Health Sector; develop Local Adaptation Plans; strengthen gender sensitivity in Mozambique's NDC actions; and, design terms of reference for developing emissions factors for the energy and waste sectors.

Other initiatives that contributed to the improvement of Mozambique's NDC are: (i) the Initiative for Transparency in Climate Action - ICAT which supported in the formulation of the Strengthened Framework for Transparency including capacity building of technicians; and, the project to formulate the First Biennial Mozambique Transparency Report (PBTRM). Since the approval of the ENAMMC, the Government has been strengthening the institutional framework in order to improve the coordination and implementation of climate change actions climate change, relevant to the implementation of the NDC:

2. To promote and coordinate the implementation of the commitments assumed in the scope of the UNFCCC and Agreements, with emphasis on the Nationally Determined Contribution and other instruments that the country ratifies in the context of climate change;

3. Disseminate climate change issues with an emphasis on financial, technological and capacity building opportunities;

4. To coordinate and ensure the timely submission of reports required under the implementation of the Convention and signed Agreements;

5. Monitor, oversee and evaluate climate change adaptation and mitigation actions including support received and report on the status of implementation These competences are attached to the National Directorate of Climate Change which has in its structure the departments of adaptation and mitigation in the Ministry of Land and Environment.

The members of the GIIMC have the responsibility to:

Represent the sector in the national climate change coordination body ensuring harmonization of national climate change actions and their sectoral integration  Report on the implementation of climate change actions in the sectors/areas they represent including challenges and needs encountered and  To technically approve the instruments, reports and other documents formulated in the context of climate change.

Data from the Anurio Estatstico 2015, estimates that Mozambique had about 25.7 million inhabitants, with about 52% being women and 48% men. According to the results of the last population census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics in 2017 indicate that the Mozambican population was 27.9 million, and the percentage of women and men remained the same. INE population projections indicate that by 2025 Mozambique will have about 34.1 million inhabitants, thus projecting a net population expansion of over 6 million inhabitants. With regard to the distribution of the population by age group (table below), particularly between 2017 and 2025, there is a decrease in the population aged between zero and 14 years old; a growth throughout the period in the population aged 15 - 64 years old as well as a growth in the population aged 65 years old and over.

Agriculture is the mainstay of the Mozambican economy, employing more than 80% of the country's economically active population (PEDSA, 2011). Furthermore, it is the sector with the highest average share in GDP, with more than 20% of the total. Manufacturing is the second sector with the highest contribution to GDP (13%), followed by trade and transport and communications services with an average of 10% each. The national economy has considerable potential in the primary sector due to the existence of various natural resources capable of the national economy is another challenge for more stable, comprehensive and sustainable growth. After several years of growth of around 7%, the national economy experienced conjunctural factors.

In Mozambique, the energy sector is experiencing a remarkable growth in the last two decades, both in terms of production and consumption of electricity and natural gas. However, rural electrification, which is estimated to average 120 000 new connections per year over the last 15 years (MTA, 2021).

To date, Mozambique has not undertaken such assessments of how the economic and social consequences of response measures have been considered in the development of the NDC. calculations show that an emissions reduction of about 180 ktCO2eq annually.

5. METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROACHES, INCLUDING THOSE FOR ESTIMATING AND ACCOUNTING FOR ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REMOVALS:

Under the Initiative for Transparency for Climate Action - ICAT Mozambique formulated in 2018, in Phase 1 of ICAT, the Roadmap for establishing a Strengthened Transparency Framework in Mozambique. This Roadmap came to be implemented in 2020 and resulted in the formulation and approval of the Mozambique National Strengthened Transparency Framework (QNFTM). the monitoring elements of the NDC; present and validate the objectives of the institutional arrangements for the National MRV System; present the proposed Enhanced Transparency Framework; present the model reports on climate change adaptation and mitigation actions; undertake group work to review the proposed Enhanced Transparency Framework and model reports, and achieve consensus on the documents under formulation in plenary discussions for validation.

Thus, the QNTFM was developed to systematically produce the following reports: Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), National Communication (CN) and the Implementation Report adopted by the CMA;

Nacional MRV System: - National Communications - GEE Inventories - Biennial Transparency Reports - Report of Implementation of the ENAMMC of the Nationally Determined Contribution (RI-AAMMC) and Adaptation Communication (AC) (Figure below).

The QNTFM has the following systems: Measuring and Reporting System, Verification System and the Academy's Technical Support. In turn, the Measurement and Reporting System and Report (track) adaptation and risk reduction, mitigation and low carbon development actions and the support received and required contained in the ENAMMC, NAP, NDC and LTS (the latter in formulation).

One of the major challenges for the operationalisation of the QNTFM and the MRV System will be the strengthening of technical-institutional capacities of the different entities at various levels.

Transparency Report or National Communication.

The process of developing emissions scenarios was done using a combination of tools, including GACMO (Greenhouse gas Abatement Cost MOdel) (Heaps, 2016), the IPCC (2006) software production (in IPPU), expansion of agricultural and livestock areas, land use changes (in AFOLU) and waste production (in the Waste sector) based on economic-social growth assumptions. Adaptation has also been done to accommodate the mitigation actions considered.

Refer to items 1b), 5a), 5b), 5d) and 5e) above.

Mozambique recognises the experience gained from implementing the Clean Development Mechanism and wishes to be supported by market mechanisms with high environmental integrity that contribute to sustainable development and establish strong incentives to harness the strength of the private sector.

In the medium and long term it intends to plan and use the carbon market or new market mechanisms.

Mozambique supports the use of market mechanisms including pre-2020 mitigation outcomes such as:

Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) generated by CDM projects and programmes;

Carbon market efforts, so as to make actions economically viable within the specific contexts of least developed countries, developing countries; and  The further development of accounting rules within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure the environmental integrity of market mechanisms and avoid double counting.

6. HOW THE PARTY CONSIDERS ITS NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION TO BE FAIR AND AMBITIOUS IN LIGHT OF ITS NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES:

However, the need to incur expenses to mitigate adverse climatic shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic, makes it necessary for external credit to increase for investment projects. It is estimated by the growing trend of current external resources that these will increase from 39,904.0 million ZZM in 2022 to 64,805.9 million ZZM in 2024.

Mozambique reserves the right to apply this paragraph in the future, including to adjust the information contained in item 1b) above.
