Updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) This submission communicates Ugandas Updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in fulfilment of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement. In the updated NDC, Uganda presents an ambitious economy-wide mitigation target in 2030 of 24.7% reduction below the Business As Usual (BAU), a progression from the 22% reduction target communicated in the first NDC in 2016.

The country's number one priority response to climate change is adaptation in the context of loss and damage, and increasing the resilience of communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. The sectoral scope for adaptation has been broadened from agriculture, forestry, water, infrastructure, energy, risk management, and health to also include ecosystems (wetlands, biodiversity, and mountains), water and sanitation, fisheries, transport, manufacturing, industry, and mining, cities and built environment, disaster risk reduction, tourism, and education.

Uganda has improved on the methodological approaches for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The implementation of the updated NDC mitigation policies and measures will be across energy, agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), peatland, waste, and industrial processes and product use (IPPU). Unlike the first NDC of 2016, the updated NDC defines sectoral mitigation and adaptation measures and interventions with clearly defined corresponding indicators and targets for 2025 and 2030. The NDC update process was conducted simultaneously with the formulation of the Long- Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS) to ensure the alignment of long-term climate change strategies with short and medium-term climate actions to represent Ugandas contribution and the fair share of domestic effort to transition to a low-carbon and climate- resilient economy in the near future.

The mitigation and adaptation actions outlined in this updated NDC will enable Uganda meet the global commitments stipulated under the Paris Agreement, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDG13), Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 20152030, and post- 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, among others. At the national level, the adaptation and mitigation actions of the updated NDC will contribute to the implementation of the country's Vision 2040, the National Development Plan III, the National Green Growth Development Strategy, and the 10-year Environment Restoration Plan, among others.

The updated NDC actions will be implemented through a whole-of-society approach, involving government ministries, departments, and agencies; the private sector; academia; civil society organizations; youth; and development partners, in accordance with the corresponding indicators and targets for 2025 and 2030. In order to effectively implement this updated NDC, Uganda will implement unconditional actions with domestic financial resources and conditional actions with assistance from external financial resources.

Therefore, I take this opportunity on behalf of the government of Uganda to present our national commitment and ambition to contribute to limiting global temperature increase to 1.5C and call upon all partners and stakeholders to support the implementation of the identified mitigation and adaptation climate actions presented in this updated NDC.

In April 2019, Uganda launched the updating process of her first NDC in pursuance of paragraph 24 of Decision 1/CP.21 of the UNFCCC under the leadership of the Climate Change Department, Ministry of Water and Environment with financial support from the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) of the NDC Partnership.

The process was coordinated by a technical team comprised of experts from the Ministry of Water and Environment; Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED); National Planning Authority (NPA); civil society and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Development Office, the NDC Partnership, Unite United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) Africa, NAP Global Network, International Organization for Migration (IOM), World Wide Fund for Nature Uganda Country Office (WWF UCO), Climate Action Network Uganda (CAN-U), ENR CSO Network, Environmental Management for Livelihood Improvement Bwaise Facility (EMLI) and Participatory Ecological Land Use Management (PELUM) Uganda among others.

I am grateful to Hon. Sam Cheptoris, Minister for Water and Environment and the entire top policy of the Ministry for the overall political guidance during the process of NDC Update. I express gratitude to the National Climate Change Advisory Committee (NCCAC), in particular, for their independent technical guidance and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Climate Change for the political oversight.

The Republic of Uganda signed the Paris Agreement (PA) in October 2015 and ratified it on the 21st of September 2016. In accordance with Decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Uganda submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2015, which later in 2016 became the countrys first NDC following the entry into force of the Paris agreement on 4th November 2016. As required by the Paris Agreement, NDCs are submitted every five years. In reference to that, this report contains Ugandas updated NDC with a time frame of 2020 to 2030.

The updated NDC contains information on national circumstances such as the geography, climate, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions profile; information on social and economic trends (population, urbanization, agriculture, forestry, water, wetlands, and energy); and policy, legal, and institutional framework.

The NDC update process was informed by a stocktake report, which highlighted the key performance levels and emerging issues that emanated from the formulation and implementation processes of the first NDC. The updated NDC addresses all the key emerging issues highlighted in the stocktake report.

The update process involved updating the national information databases for adaptation and mitigation to generate scientific information in accordance with Article 4 Paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement to inform decisions on climate actions for 2020 to 2030. Uganda used the latest global and national information packages generated from the national risk and vulnerability assessment, the mitigation metabolic assessments, and the third national communication. The country gathered information on climate, climate change risk, and vulnerability, and GHG emission trends, sources, and projections up to 2050 using a set of tools for GHG emissions estimations and projections, taking into account the national circumstances and the countrys vision for 2040, which informed the choices of the appropriate mitigation measures and adaptation actions in the updated NDC.

Results from the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment conducted indicated that both temperature and rainfall are expected to increase in Uganda. However, there is still a wide mining and quarrying, energy, transport, and cities and the built environment.

The adaptation component of this updated NDC covers 13 sectors of agriculture, forestry, energy, health, ecosystems (wetlands, biodiversity, and mountains), water and sanitation, risk reduction, tourism, and education, highlighting 48 priority adaptation actions and 82 indicators with targets for 2025 and 2030.

The mitigation component presents Ugandas emissions profile, which is projected to increase from 90.1 MtCO2e in 2015 to 148.8 MtCO2e in 2030 and 235.7 MtCO2e by 2050 under the Business-As-Usual (BAU) Scenario. Uganda plans to implement policies and measures in the AFOLU, energy, waste, transport, and IPPU sectors that will result in a 24.7% reduction of national GHG emissions below the BAU trajectory in 2030, to 112.1 MtCO2e. 82.7% of the mitigation impact will come from the AFOLU sector, while 7.56%, 6.36%, 3%, and 0.4% will come from the transport, energy, waste, and IPPU sectors, respectively. The 24.7% reduction bears both conditional and unconditional targets. The 5.9% (unconditional target) BAU emission reduction by 2030 will be facilitated by domestic resources, and the 18.8% support such as financial resources, capacity-building, and technology transfer.

Gender sensitivity was incorporated in the selection and prioritization of adaptation and mitigation measures and actions of this NDC, and it was further elaborated and mainstreamed in the updated NDC implementation plan.

The total cost of implementing adaptation, mitigation, coordination, monitoring, and reporting of this updated NDC is estimated at USD 28.1 billion. Uganda commits to mobilize domestic resources to cover the unconditional actions to the tune of USD 4.1 billion equivalent to 15% of the total cost of the updated NDC and will require international support to cover the conditional measures and actions. A number of capacity-building and technology needs have also been identified for implementing the NDC.

The Republic of Uganda signed the Paris Agreement in October 2015 and ratified it on the 21st of September 2016.

In pursuant to decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 24, Uganda committed to update its first NDC and on 30th April 2019 and a roadmap to update the first NDC was launched. Uganda through the Ministry of Water and Environment (Climate Change Department) with support from the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) of the NDC Partnership through partners  UNDP, GIZ, UNEP, IRENA, RCCC and ICLEI Africa facilitated the formulation of the updated NDC which embraced the whole -of government and of whole -of -society gender responsive approach where various categories  youth, women groups among others fully participated in a bottom-up approach.

The updated NDC is aligned with the Vision 2040 and the third National Development Plan (NDP III) 2020/21  2024/25. The updated NDC has been informed by the National Climate Change Act, 2021, the National Climate Change Policy, 2015, the Uganda Green Growth Development Strategy, 2017/18  2030/31, Uganda NDC Partnership Plan 2018  2020, the Stock-take report of Ugandas NDC and other related policies, plans and strategies. The updated NDC has been harmonized with the development of Ugandas Long-term Climate Strategy 2050.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the hybrid mode of participation through regional workshops, youth and civil society consultations enabled the identification of various climate actions which were discussed and prioritised by policy makers during the sectoral consultations which ensured alignment with overarching national planning and budgeting frameworks.

Developing gender responsive NDC with measurable targets is essential to improving performance in climate action. Identifying the gender equity in targets NDC aim to achieve - along with the concrete actions needed to achieve the targets and the required indicators to measure progress - are essential steps for addressing challenges related to climate change and gender equality. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence and broad international consensus that advancing gender equity helps reduce poverty, supports inclusive growth and other general development outcomes, and enhances the effectiveness and sustainability of development initiatives. However, without explicit targets, and actions to ensure gender equality and equity, the needs of the marginalised and disadvantaged continue to be overlooked.

During the process of developing this NDC, gender sensitivity of the NDC adaptation and mitigation actions and targets has been ensured through the selection and prioritization processes utilized in developing this NDC (see Appendix A), and further gender mainstreaming will be done in the NDC implementation plan This updated NDC is an articulation of Ugandas mitigation and adaptation contributions towards the implementation (aspirations) objectives of the Paris Agreement in 2030. The updated NDC sets out targets, measures and actions which prescribe the domestic contributions aimed at achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The updated NDC is structured in the following chapters:

Chapter 1: National Circumstances  describes the context of Ugandas updated NDC, information on the countrys geography; climate; population; an overview on economic situation; an assessment of the impacts and vulnerabilities; and relevant climate change policies, institutions, and regulatory frameworks.

Chapter 2: Adaptation Component of the NDC  highlights adaptation planning, priorities, gaps, and outlines the priority adaptation actions and targets to be implemented.

Chapter 3: Mitigation Component of the NDC  describes baseline emission projection, emissions scenarios, mitigation targets in sectors of AFOLU, Energy, Transport, Waste and Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) as well as mitigation actions and measures to be implemented in contribution towards the achieving the set-out economy-wide emission reduction target.

Chapter 4: Means of Implementation  highlights climate financing needs for implementation of the updated NDC, financing mechanism, capacity-building and technology needs.

1.1 Geography, Climate, and Emissions Profile Uganda is a Least Developed Country located in East Africa. It occupies an area of 241,555 square kilometres, with water bodies.

Ugandas climate is largely tropical with most parts of the country experiencing bi-modal rainy seasons per year expect for northern region and is largely influenced by Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) systems.

Rainfall in Uganda is experienced during two distinct periods annually: the short rains from October to December and the long rains from March to May. For climatological period 1991- 2020, the total annual average precipitation was 1,197 mm, and mean monthly precipitation of the country varies from 39.6 mm in January to 152.7 mm in April (World Bank Group, 2021)1. Figure 1-1 below presents the observed spatial distribution of average annual precipitation and temperature.

Climate Change Country Profile for Uganda shows a statistically significant decreasing trend lake levels and could also impact on the production of hydropower among the several potential impacts.

The country experiences moderate temperatures ranging from 25C  29C on average. Since 1950, average temperature has increased at a rate of 0.23 C/decade. The increasing temperatures have resulted in increased trends in the frequency of hot days and nights (UNMA, 2019 State of Climate Report).

Figure 1-1: Average annual temperature (left); annual precipitation (right), 199120202 The IPCC 6th assessment report (AR6) has noted that human-induced climate change already affects many weather and climate extremes in every region globally (IPCC, 2021). Warming trends observed in recent decades are projected to continue over the 21st century and over most land regions at a rate higher than the global average. The AR6 report also confirmed increase since the previous studies was the greatest (IPCC, 2021). Figure 1-2 shows the latest scenarios for annual temperatures, precipitation and rainfall intensity for Africa.

Figure 1-2: Future climate change scenarios for Africa  median impacts by 2100 Figure 1-3: Projected Mean Temperature and Precipitation for Uganda The projections in figure 1-3 show that both temperature and precipitation are expected to of the AR5 and are based on the CMIP6 emissions scenarios used in the IPCC AR6. In comparison to previous ARs scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the AR6 used five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that provide a broader view of scenarios without future climate policy (Business As Usual), with global warming in 2100 ranging from 3.1 C to 5.1 C above pre-industrial levels.

Since the publication of AR53 (IPCC, 2014), the country has conducted several climate analyses. As part of the LTS formulation and NDC update process, the existing climate scenarios were reviewed and a synthesis of results is presented in Table 1.1 below. Table 1-1: Temperature and Precipitation Projections up to 2100 RCP 2.6 RCP 4.5 RCP 8.5 RCP 2.6 RCP 4.5 RCP 8.5 anomaly 0.5 to 1 C 1.4 to 2 C 1.8 to 3 C 1 to 1.5 C Rainfall -10 mm -10 mm -10 mm -10 mm -10 mm -20 mm Additionally, under the Third National Communication (TNC-Uganda) climate analysis reveals that Ugandas mean temperature has been significantly changing at the rate of 0.030C per decade, with a significant level of 99.8% for the period 1951 to 2020, 99.9% for the period 1971 to 2020, and 87.6% for the period 1991 to 2020. The minimum temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.03 0C for the periods of 1951 to 2020 and 1971 to 2020, and 0.020C for the period of 1991 to 2020, while the maximum temperature has increased at a rate of 0.030C for the same periods, with a significance level of above 85%.

The annual rainfall totals have been decreasing at the rate of 10.3 mm per decade for the periods 1951 to 2020 and 1971 to 2020 with a significant level of over 95% and decreased by 3.58 mm for the period 1971 to 2020 with no significance. The spatial trend of annual rainfall syr.ipcc.ch/topic_summary.php#node145.

The mean annual temperature projections indicate an increase from 1 to 1.50C under low, moderate, and high greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration scenarios of RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 for most parts of the country, while RCP 8.5 projects an increase in temperature of 1.5 to 30C relative to the 1981-2010 average for most parts of the country.

The mean total annual rainfall, unlike temperature, does not show a similar pattern across the country, whereas in some areas, rainfall is projected to increase and in others rainfall is projected to decrease. Under RCP 2.6, much of the country's rainfall is not expected to change significantly by mid-century as compared to the 19812010 average, apart from the Masindi, Hoima area (mid-western Uganda), and Karamoja (north-eastern) regions, where rainfall is projected to decrease by 5 to 10% relative to the baseline.

Under RCP 4.5, no significant changes are also projected across the country, with only the South Western highlands projected to have an increase in rainfall of between 5 and 10% relative to the baseline.

In contrast, Under RCP 8.5 scenario, the mean annual rainfall by mid-century is expected to decrease by 5 to 15% in most parts of central Uganda and increase by 5 to 10% in south- western.

Ugandas GHG emissions have slowly increased from 53.4 MtCO2e in 2005 to 90.1 MtCO2e in 2015 (Figure 2-4). The Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry category was dominant, accounting for 59.5% (53.6 MtCO2e) of the total emissions. The Land sector was estimated to be a source of emissions instead of a sink. Agriculture is the second largest, contributing 26.9%, followed by energy (10.7%) and waste (2.3%). The Industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector accounted for the least emissions.

Figure 1-4: Sectoral trends in GHG emissions for Uganda The population of Uganda has grown from 12.6 million people in 1980 to 34.6 million people respectively (Uganda Bureau of Statistics, 2020)4. The average annual growth rate over the last 10 years has been less than 3%. Ugandas population pyramid has a broad base, indicating a very young population and Uganda had the second highest dependency ratio (ratio of non-working age population to working age population) in the world in 2014 (Hausmann et al., 2014)5, but this has been declining and in 2019 Uganda moved down to the seventh highest in the world. The population is evenly split between males and females.

The total working population was estimated at 15 million in 2016/17 with 51% of workers being female with 39% of the working population involved in subsistence agriculture. The unemployment rate was estimated at 9.2% (Uganda Bureau of Statistics, 2020).

Urbanisation has been occurring steadily in Uganda, at an estimated rate of 19%. The country has one of the highest urban population growth rates in the world (5.4%). Projections anticipate that urbanisation at the current pace would result in an urban population of more than 20 million by 2040, and 32 million by 2050. Other secondary urban areas are also beginning to attract rural migrants to the cities. Typically, secondary cities are trading and service centres, with some Agro-processing activities. Urbanisation is an opportunity to improve waste management through the installation of more centralised waste treatment centres.

Even though 65% of new jobs being created are in urban centres, urban areas have not been effective at inducing formal wage growth and job creation due to the large informal sector. Uganda has a dual economy with the informal sector contributing a significant share to the GDP (51%). The private sector is dominated by micro, small and medium enterprises, which employ about 2.5 million people. The size and strength of the informal economy creates a lot of competition, which constrains the size of the formal enterprises. The inadequate quality transport infrastructure also hinders the connection between cities and external markets.

The growing population, urbanisation, industrialisation and technology advancements have contributed to a change in the composition of waste (NPA 2017). The bio-degradable organic waste contribution has been declining, while plastic and paper waste have been increasing. In addition, the new waste profile indicates an increase in electronic waste, chemical waste, oil and gas waste and other hazardous waste. There is high solid waste generation in urban areas of approximately 0.56 kg/person/day. Urban solid waste is mainly organic (green and food waste) and accounts for 72% while plastics and paper waste accounted for 12.4% and 10.2% respectively.

1980 1991 2002 2014 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Agriculture is an important part of Ugandas economy and over 71.8% of the land area is under cultivation. Subsistence farming covers the largest portion as compared to commercial cultivation (FAO, 2016). The country's agricultural productivity trends show a mixed picture, with increasing maize, rice, millet, simsim, cassava, and sweet potato yields and decreasing cotton, coffee, and banana yields, as well as increasing cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry numbers and products, and a gradual decline in fish stocks (Situation Analysis Study for degradation.

According to Forest Resources Assessment (FRA), the forest area covers 11.66% of the total land area of Uganda and is declining due to deforestation at an annual rate of 1.44% (FRA, 2020)6. Deforestation has remained the primary cause of the decline in forest cover from 24% in 1990 to 10% in 2017. Private land forest cover has shrunk from 16% to 4% of the total national land area, while protected forests have shrunk from 8% to 6%. Outside of protected areas (PAs), forest cover declined from 67% in 1990 to 38% in 2017.

Uganda has a large water resource, both surface and groundwater. However, national access to safe water stood at 67% in 2020, with access in rural areas at 68% and urban areas at 70.5%. About 43% of households have only limited or no access to safe drinking water (Figure purposes is also limited and uncertain.

For sanitation, only 20% of population have access to basic sanitation services and 45% of the population have no hand washing facilities at home which presents a significant health risk.

6 Report 2020 Uganda Wood & Forest Resources Accounts.indd (ubos.org) Figure 1-6: Summary of Water, Sanitation and Health data for Uganda (WHO/UNICEF JMP, 2021) Wetlands are a critical part of Ugandas natural resources since they do not only provide wetland ecosystem services such as water supply, water treatment, flood protection, fuel, and construction materials, but also a source of employment. Wetlands are declining and degradation is increasing, with the main drivers being population explosion, expansion of land for agriculture, socio-economic pressures, and industrial development. Wetland coverage in 2020 was 8.9%, down from 10.9% in 2014.

Uganda is a rich country in terms of energy resources which include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, wind, oil and gas. However, the countrys energy potential has not been fully harnessed. To ensure a sustainable electricity supply, the country has created a conducive regulatory environment and incentives aimed at diversifying the countrys energy generation mix.

The total installed generation capacity has grown from 60 MW in 1954 to 1,267.2 MW as of 2020 (MEMD, 2020). Biomass continues to play an important part in Uganda's economy, accounting for more than 89% of total primary consumable energy.

Uganda Vision 2040 is the country's ambitious long-term development blueprint. The vision for the integration of climate change governance into development planning. It aims to transform Uganda from a predominantly low-income country to a competitive upper middle- income country. The country has so far developed 3 consecutive National Development Plans (NDP) to implement vision 2040.

The NDP III's Program 9: Natural resources, environment, climate change, land and water management recognizes the importance of addressing climate-related disasters by promoting inclusive, climate-resilient, and low-emissions development at all levels.

Uganda developed the National Climate Change Policy in 2015 to guide efforts towards achieving Vision 2040 and moving towards low-carbon development. The policy aims to ensure that stakeholders address climate change impacts and causes through appropriate measures while promoting sustainable development and a green economy. The policy emphasizes climate change adaptation as the top priority for Uganda, given that the countrys greenhouse gas emissions are still relatively very low and yet the country is experiencing climate change risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities.

Additionally, the country has developed other policies, plans and strategies that are relevant to addressing climate change challenge such as;

National Disaster Preparedness and Management Policy, 2010; National Agricultural Policy, 2013; Renewable Energy Policy, 2007; National Forestry Policy, 2001; National Irrigation Policy, 2017, National Health Policy, 2010; National Land Policy, 2013; and Uganda non- motorised transport policy, 2013 among others.

The country has also developed the following strategies:

Uganda Green Growth Development Strategy 2017/18-2030/31; Uganda National Climate Change Communication Strategy 2017-2021; the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience, 2017; the National REDD+ Strategy, and Action Plan, 2017; National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan II 2015 -2025; Uganda Sustainable Land Management Strategic Investment Framework (2010-2020); the Climate Smart Agriculture. Program (2015  2025).

Among the plans, Uganda developed the Forest Investment Plan, 2017 and the National Adaptation Plan for Agriculture, 2018; and Uganda NDC Partnership Plan, 2018 among others.

Uganda developed and enacted the National Climate Change Act 2021 to give force of law to the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. The Act provides for climate change mechanisms, including compliance, emissions trading mechanisms, as well as measurement of greenhouse gas emissions reductions and removal. The Act provides for the GHG emissions to be prescribed by the Minister responsible for climate change in consultation with the policy committee.

The Act also provides for climate change financing as well as incentives for those involved in implementing response measures for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

Uganda has put in place institutional arrangements for coordination, supervision, regulation, and management of all activities related to climate change. The Ministry of Water and Environment, Climate Change Department is the mandated institution for coordination, monitoring, and evaluation of national programs and actions on climate change and ensures that the country meets its obligations and realizes benefits under the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement.

The National Climate Change Act, 2021 provides for other institutions, which include: The Policy Committee on Environment, mandated with the role of advising the department and lead agencies on implementation of the Act and the National Climate Change Policy; the National Climate Change Advisory Committee, mandated with the responsibility of providing independent technical advice to the policy committee on environment and the minister. The Act also stipulates the responsibilities of the Lead Agencies, the District Natural Resources Department, and District Committees responsible for climate change, as well as lower local government committees responsible for climate change.

Uganda undertook the process of updating its first NDC in pursuance of paragraph 24 of Decision 1/CP.21 to update the NDC by 2020. In April 2019, Uganda launched the update process under the leadership of the Ministry of Water and Environment/Climate Change Department with support from the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) of the NDC Partnership implemented by partners: UNDP; GIZ; IRENA; UNEP; Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, IUCN and ICLEI Africa.

The update process was informed by a stocktake of NDC implementation that highlighted the performance of the first NDC and emerging issues, which included unclear methodological approaches for estimating and accounting for GHG emissions and lack of adaptation and mitigation sectoral targets, among others. The NDC update process involved: broadening the scope of sectors of the first NDC; defining adaptation targets, vulnerability index, and ambition; development of sectoral emission targets; and improving methods, data, and information quality. Uganda used a set of tools to project its GHG emission trajectory, taking into account the countrys vision 2040, which included the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP), Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM) and Excel models based on methodological assumptions and data in the FBUR for Uganda.

The NDC update process undertook a whole -of -government engagement and whole of society approach involving youth, women, the private sector, and civil society. Updating was conducted simultaneously with the development of the Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LTS), benefitting from joint modelling, assessments, progressive reviews, and stakeholder consultation for proper alignment. The updated NDC actions and measures were subjected to a multi-criteria analysis and a detailed gender analysis.

2 ADAPTATION COMPONENT OF THE UPDATED NDC Climate risks pose serious threats to Uganda's key economic sectors, such as agriculture, water resources, fisheries, tourism, and health, which are dependent and sensitive to climate variability and change. Climate change has severe direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystems, livelihoods, and economic development in Uganda.

The National Risk and Vulnerability Atlas of Uganda identifies droughts, floods, landslides, windstorms, hailstorms, lightning, as the major climate-induced hazards.

Uganda is gradually improving adaptation readiness and actions to address the impacts of climate change. In 2007, a National Adaptation Program of Actions (NAPA) was developed and submitted to the UNFCCC, which identified the urgent and immediate actions to respond to climate change.

As part of the adaptation planning processes, in 2016, Uganda communicated her first NDC with an adaptation component; in 2017, Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR) was developed; in 2018, formulated a National Adaptation Plan for the Agriculture Sector (NAP Ag) and in 2021, initiated a process for the preparation of an Adaptation Communication. Uganda is moving towards medium-to-long-term planning for adaptation. Since 2021, the country has initiated the formulation of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to strengthen adaptation planning, governance, and coordination; develop tools for adaptation planning; and secure finance for adaptation. The country has established a National Adaptation Technical Working Group to guide and support the NAP process and overall adaptation planning.

However, Uganda's adaptation effort faces several challenges, including but not limited to inadequate local level climate adaptation financing, inadequate individual and institutional capacity, limited access to international climate finance, and support for technology and capacity-building.

Overview of Climate Risks and Vulnerability As part of the NDC update process, Uganda conducted a comprehensive climate change risk and vulnerability assessment. Uganda's climate is highly variable and changing, according to the assessment, and the country is rated highly vulnerable, with a high degree of exposure, sensitivity, and low adaptive capacity. The vulnerability and risk assessment ratings are presented in the table 2-1.

Table 2-1: Results from the vulnerability and risk assessment, by sector Agriculture (crop and livestock) 4.07 4.18 vulnerable, high risk).

Climate change is impacting and is projected to impact physical infrastructure, food security, water resources, agriculture, energy, health, and ecosystems. An assessment of the economic impacts of climate change in Uganda indicated that adaptation inaction could result in annual costs rising in the range of USD 3.25.9 billion within a decade. Even if there were no further such as increase in population.

Priority Sectors for Adaptation.

The vulnerability and risk assessment indicated that the priority sectors for adaptation in Uganda remain ecosystems, water, agriculture, and forestry. These were also identified as the Fisheries sub-sector, Manufacturing and Mining, the Cities and Built environment, Transport, and Health. With a high dependency on hydropower, the Energy sector is also at risk due to climate variability and change in rainfall and water availability.

For all sectors, a significant cross-cutting issue remains the disaster risk sector, which has also been identified as a priority area for adaptation globally.

3 MITIGATION COMPONENT OF THE UPDATED NDC Ugandas greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are projected to increase from 90.1 MtCO2e in 2015 to 148.8 MtCO2e in 2030 and 235.7 MtCO2e by 2050 under the BAU Scenario. This is illustrated in figure 3-1 below.

Figure 3-1: Uganda's BAU GHG emissions trajectory To mitigate these GHG emissions, Uganda intends to implement a suite of circular economy mitigation actions in the sectors and sub-sectors presented in the table 3-1 below.

This is a result of sector prioritization that was done through a metabolic assessment.

Based on the availability of financial, capacity building and technology support, Uganda will 3-2 below.

3.3 Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Sector AFOLU sector is the greatest contributor to Ugandas GHG emissions, especially due to deforestation for various reasons including energy use, agriculture and logging. In 2020 national deforestation rates stand were estimated at 1.44%. Uganda has committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 and to increase forest cover from an estimated 12.5% in 2020 to 15% in 2025 and 21% in 2030. In addition, the country launched a 40 million tree campaign on 2 March 2021, focussing on forest restoration using indigenous trees.

3.3.1 Priority Mitigation Policies and Measures In the AFOLU sector, the priority mitigation policies and measures are from REDD+ activities, based on the National REDD+ Strategy and Action Plan published in 2017 (MWE, 2017). These policies and measures are outlined in the table below.

It is expected that the irrigation practice will irrigation systems, contributing to about 1.6 MtCO2e reduction by 2030.

2. Sustainable fuelwood and commercial charcoal production bioenergy woodlots all over Uganda.

The measure is expected to contribute to a farm forestry practices.

This measure aims to increase the uptake of efficient charcoal production technologies whilst contributing to the objective of the biomass energy strategy for Uganda, which aims at balancing the supply and demand for biomass energy. Traditional charcoal kilns have a wood conversation efficiency of 12%.

3. Agriculture Promote cultivation of high yielding upland rice.

The NAMA seeks to increase rice production in Uganda by promoting cultivation of high yielding upland rice as opposed to low land paddy rice in parts of Uganda where rice is a from rice cultivations.

The Energy sector in Uganda consists of four sub-sectors; Industrial, Residential, Commercial/ in the country and it is followed by industries, commercial/institutional, agricultural and fisheries. Biomass is the primary source of energy in the country.

Majority of the Ugandan population is rural-based and has limited access to the electricity grid. As a result, they depend on biomass for basic household energy needs. In 2005, direct combustion of fuel for energy use in the residential sector was approximately 369,000 TJ (Ministry of Water and Environment, 2019), of which the vast majority (almost 99.5%) was from biomass sources. The remainder (0.5%) was from liquid fuels (e.g., kerosene). In addition to energy from direct combustion, the residential sector also consumed 2,177 TJ of electricity. In 2015, direct combustion of fuel for energy in the industry sector was around 116,000 TJ, of which the vast majority (89%) was from biomass sources (Ministry of Water and Environment, addition to energy from direct combustion, the industry sector also consumed approximately energy in the commercial sector was around 19,000 TJ, of which the vast majority (almost 91.5%) was from biomass sources. The remainder (8.5%) was from liquid fuels. Production systems in the agriculture/forestry/fisheries subsector are the lowest consumers of energy in Uganda.

3.4.1 Main Mitigation Policies and Measures There are several mitigation measures envisaged to be put in place in the Energy sector in sub-sector.

Table 3-6: Mitigation actions in Energy sub-sector Sub-sectors Mitigation action Description and impact The measure aims to increase energy generation in the country by promoting renewable energy resources. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.0003 MtCO2e by 2030.

The measure intends to reduce energy losses during transmission and distribution. This will improve available energy in the country. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.00001 MtCO2e by 2030.

The measure is aimed at improving efficiency of charcoal production which will have an impact of reducing deforestation in the forestry sector. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.48 MtCO2e by 2030.

The objective of this measure is to improve energy efficiency in the industrial sector and reduce electricity consumption. Key consumers that are targeted are process heating and process cooling, motors and refrigeration. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.26 MtCO2e by 2030.

This measure is aimed at switching energy consumption in the industrial sector from biomass to renewable electricity. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.23 MtCO2e by 2030.

This measure aims to increase electricity access of the households so that the households dependence on biomass can be reduced. This will reduce deforestation. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.02 MtCO2e by 2030.

The measure intends to introduce more energy efficient lighting technologies (CFLs, LEDs etc) and to replace lighting fuels (kerosene) with cleaner energy sources. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 0.003 MtCO2e by 2030.

This measure aims to improve energy efficiency during cooking by adoption of efficient charcoal and fuelwood stoves and to change from using biomass as main source energy for cooking to the use of cleaner energy resources. This can lead emission reductions of approximately 1.09 MtCO2e by 2030.

The main mitigation actions above have a potential to reduce GHG emissions in this sector by 18.8% to 10.1 MtCO2e in 2030 as shown in figure 3-5. The Figure also presents the sectors annual mitigation targets.

Figure 3-5: Energy sector baseline and annual targets under the mitigation scenario Table 3-12: Additional Mitigation actions  Strengthen enforcement of the mining Act, 2003 and the National Environment Act, 2019 and all the relevant regulations, one of the pillars of which is respect for the environment and compliance with the Acts (and its implementing provisions);

Evaluate the feasibility of establishing and operating a financial mechanism for the mining sector to fund the contribution to the fight against climate change;

Boost the sector's energy efficiency by conducting awareness campaigns to sensitize mining companies on sustainable energy utilization  Supply this sector with electricity from renewable sources as far as possible. Predicted future power demand from the mining sector alone, could absorb more than 30% of the hydroelectric potential identified to date.

Promoting establishment of ESCOs enhances preparation and management of large energy efficiency projects for implementation for high energy consuming industries.

Implementing this standard in industries requires industries to put in place systems and policies for continued energy improvement in their operations.

Regulating energy utilization in buildings for cooling, heating, ventilation and hot water is in alignment with health, comfort, well-being and sustainability, including improving energy productivity and reducing CO2 emissions Baseline 5.66 5.78 6.06 6.36 6.68 7.03 7.39 7.77 8.17 8.59 10.0 10.9 11.3 11.7 12.1 12.4 NDC 5.66 5.71 5.91 6.12 6.33 6.56 6.79 7.02 7.26 7.46 8.66 9.51 9.73 10.0 10.3 10.1 Ugandas transport system can be divided into five sectors: (1) road transport; (2) rail transport; (3) air transport, (4) inland water transport; and (5) other modes (LEDS, 2018)7. Road transport is the dominant mode, carrying over 95% of total traffic (LEDS, 2018). The public road network, including both classified and unclassified roads, comprises more than 140,000 km. In 2018/2019, about 96 percent of freight cargo and passenger traffic was delivered by road (National Planning Authority, 2020)8. The city of Kampala in particular accounts for over 50% of the vehicles in Uganda (Ministry of Water and Environment, 2015)9.

Majority of vehicles in Uganda originate from Japan, imported as reconditioned units, usually more than 5 years old. The current motorised vehicle fleet is approximately 1,355,090 vehicles, up from 739,036 in 2012, with the average age of vehicles being more than 15 years old. Public passenger transport in Uganda is a mix between cars, motorcycles, minibuses and buses (Ministry of Works and Transport)10.

Civil aviation transport has also expanded rapidly in recent years. International passenger numbers per annum increased during the last 8 years from 781,428 to 1,303,484 in 2016. International traffic dominates flights at Entebbe, up to 97% for passengers and 99% for cargo. Entebbe International Airport is currently undergoing expansion in order to cater for the increasing passenger traffic and cargo freight (Ministry of Works and Transport). Rail and waterway services are generally in a run-down state (National Transport Master Plan, 2015)11. The current market shares of railways declined from 12% to 5% within the last 8 years (Ministry of Works and Transport). Railway Transport sector has been operating below its of real estate property and theft of track materials (Ministry of Works and Transport).

Road transport is responsible for 84% of transport energy. It is followed by domestic aviation with 11%, and rail and water transport that consume 3% of the total each.

3.5.1 Main Mitigation Policies and Measures Table 3-13: Main mitigation actions to be implemented in the Transport sector in 2030 Sub-sectors Mitigation Measure Description and impact consumption.

This measure aims to improve national fleet database, frameworks, and fuel standards so that regulation of the sub-sector can be enhanced, including regulations of imported vehicles. This measure can reduce the emissions by approximately 1.86 MtCO2e by 2030.

This measure intends to improve fuel standards and efficiency in the country. Cleaner fuels will be promoted. This measure has potential to reduce emissions by approximately 0.54 MtCO2e by 2030. This measure aims to use the planned NMT corridors in the GKMA as well as in other urban areas across Uganda as its basis. The measure has a potential to reduce the emissions by approximately 0.66 MtCO2e by 2030.

This measure intends to implement 61 km of passenger rail by 2030 and to achieve 22% of fuel economy improvement of diesel locomotives. This measure has a potential to reduce the emissions by approximately 0.0005 MtCO2e by 2030.

Transport sector GHG emissions under Business-As-Usual conditions will more than double from 4.2 MtCO2e in 2015 to 9.6 MtCO2e in 2030. If all the main mitigation measures under the NDC scenario are implemented fully, they have the potential to limit the growth of the emissions by 29% to 6.8 MtCO2e in 2030 as illustrated in the figure 3-6. The figure also presents annual targets under the transport sector mitigation scenario.

Waste composition is changing rapidly in Uganda particularly in urban areas. Waste generation rate in tonnes per day, is increasing annually in the cities because of growing urbanization. The country generates waste in the form of domestic and industrial wastewater as well as solid waste. Despite challenges of poor data collection systems, it is estimated that the content of biodegradable material in the country decreased from 88.5% in 1990 to 77% in 2014. Content of plastics in the waste waste was generated in Uganda in 2017. The city of Kampala is responsible for half of the waste generated in the country.

Volumes of wastewater are also increasing in the country especially in the cities. However, there are limited sewage systems with many households constructing their own septic tanks. The fraction of households that are connected to the municipal sewage system in the cities is estimated to be only 1%19 with a projected growth to 30% in the next decade. In the absence of wastewater collection and treatment services, households often rely on onsite sanitation systems, such as pit latrines. In this case, GHG emissions depend on the individual use of the system, e.g. poor flush latrines vs. dry latrines, the quality and efficiency of faecal sludge management and the type of faecal sludge treatment.

Baseline assumptions:

The population with access to waste management services was assumed to grow in line with national population growth, while consumption, waste generation and solid waste management practices are assumed to remain the same over the projected period. The following assumptions were made for solid waste disposal:

Waste management technologies remain constant from 2015 (40% unmanaged shallow and 60 percent managed anaerobic);

Degradable organic carbon fraction remains constant for all waste types;  Waste per capita remains constant at average 2002 - 2015 value (237 kg/capita/yr);

Percent of waste sent to managed sites remains constant at 2015 value (60%);  Waste categorization remains constant at 2015 values (38.7% food; 34.4% garden; 10.6% paper; 1.3% wood; 0.5% textile; 0.5% nappies; and 14% plastics); (WHO) and the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), 2021. Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO  Sludge sent to managed sites remains constant at 2015 value (0%); and,  Amount of methane recovered remains constant at 2015 value (zero kg). For wastewater treatment and discharge, it was assumed that consumption, wastewater generation and treatment practices remain the same over the projected period, while wastewater generation grows in line with national population growth. The following specific assumptions for wastewater treatment and discharge were made:

Degradable organic component remains at default value;

Types of treatment and discharge remain constant from 2015 to 2025 (mostly anaerobic deep lagoon; the remainder, latrine); from 2025, mostly septic tank and latrine; the remainder, lagoon;

Fraction of population using different treatments remains constant from 2015 to 2025 (mostly anaerobic deep lagoon; the remainder, latrine); from 2025, mostly septic tank and latrine; the remainder, lagoon;

Degree of technology use remains constant from 2015 to 2025 (mostly anaerobic deep lagoon; the remainder, latrine); from 2025, mostly septic tank and latrine, the remainder  Per capita protein consumption remains constant as of 2015 (17.888 kg/person/year). For industrial wastewater treatment and discharge, future activity was assumed to increase in line with the historical increase for the period 2005 - 2015.

3.6.1 Main mitigation Policies and Measures Table 3-16: Main mitigation Policies and Measures Sub-sectors Mitigation Measure Description and Impact This measure will target green development in the large municipal areas. It will look into improving infrastructure in the cities. This measure has potential to reduce emissions by approximately 1.1 MtCO2e by 2030.

This measure is aimed at introducing biogas digesters in schools. Biogas digesters will be fed by waste from bio latrines and used for cooking. The measure has potential to reduce the emissions by 0.0006 MtCO2e by 2030.

The waste sector produces relatively smaller amounts of greenhouse gas emissions as compared to other sectors. Two main mitigation measures in the waste sector are planned;

ii. School bio latrines  Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action Table 3-17 gives a description of the proposed mitigation measures for the waste sector.

Table 3-17: Waste mitigation measures by sub-sectors Support comprehensive physical planning and efficient waste management (solid and wastewater) for five cities and 15 municipalities.

This will entail proper implementation of the waste hierarchy and relevant regulations, including reduction, recycling and reuse of solid waste, and wastewater treatment in the cities of Greater Kampala Metropolitan City (GKMC), Gulu, Mbarara, Hoima and Mbale, as well as 15 municipalities. It includes acquisition of land for infrastructure and service facilities for sanitation, solid waste management and drainage services.

Improving cooking and sanitation conditions of schools through use of bio latrines (biogas digesters).

Under the BAU scenario, the waste sector emissions are projected to grow from 2.08 MtCO2e in the base year to 3.19 MtCO2e in 2030. If fully implemented, the main mitigation measures and policies are projected to reduce the 2030 emissions by 34.8% to 2.09 MtCO2e. This is illustrated in figure 3-7.

.

Figure 3-7: Waste sector baseline and annual targets under the NDC scenario The figure also presents the annual mitigation targets for the AFOLU sector. Planned green cities waste management has high mitigation potential over the schools bio latrines and can account for nearly all the current potential abatements in the NDC scenario.

Table 3-18: Additional mitigation measures under the Waste sector Waste from sugarcane is increasing in the country. There is potential to generate energy from this waste. Energy generation potential from this waste needs to be investigated.

The NAMA seeks to increase efficiency and value addition prospects for wastewater treatment of agro-processing firms by establishing an integrated wastewater treatment process using both an anaerobic and aerobic digester with sequencing batch reactor. Methane will be captured as biogas. The NAMA will address methane emissions from agro-process wastewater treatment, which were estimated at 14,358 tCO2e/year for effluent from 11 fish factories and Enhancing wastewater collection and treatment, including Achieving energy neutrality in wastewater treatment plants Implement measures to improve the energy balance of water and wastewater treatment and transportation, including technological upgrades of aeration and compressors; sludge management; pipes maintenance;

Replacement of fossil energy sources with renewable energy in water and wastewater management.

Ugandas industrial sector continues to grow having been prioritised as a key programme in her NDP III. The sector has a high potential for enhanced economies of scale for factor productivity and deeper, more dynamic and stronger forward and backward linkages with other sectors. Emissions in this sector are from cement production, lime production, iron and steel production, lubricant use, refrigeration and air conditioning. Cement production accounts for the highest share of emissions within the sector. Two types of cement are produced in the country: Portland cement and Pozzolana Portland Cement. The clicker fractions in the Portland cement and Pozzolana Portland Cement are 95% and 72% respectively (Ministry of Water and Environment, 2019).

Because cement production is responsible for the majority of emissions in the IPPU sector, is a component of cement and is essentially a mix of limestone and minerals that have been heated and transformed in a kiln. The table 3-19 presents the main and additional mitigation measures for this sector.

This measure aims to substitute clinker in cement production with less carbon intensive constituents like pozzolana, fly-ash or slag. This measure has a potential to reduce the emissions by approximately 0.10 MtCO2e by 2030.

Other constituents (i.e., pozzolana, fly-ash or slag) are used to replace clinker in cement, thereby lowering emissions and energy use.

Refrigerant use Circular economy management of refrigerants Under Business-as-Usual scenario, the industrial processes and product use sector emissions are projected to grow from 0.57 MtCO2e in 2015 to 1.0 MtCO2e in 2030. Implementation of the main mitigation measure has the potential to reduce the emissions in this sector by 14% to 0.86 MtCO2e in 2030 as shown in the figure 3-8. The figure also presents the annual mitigation targets for the IPPU sector.

Under the Climate and Clean Air 3 Coalition's Supporting National Action & Planning (SNAP) initiative, Uganda is enhancing institutional capacity to address climate change and air pollution through the development of national ambient air quality regulations and standards and by integrating climate change and clean air strategies.

Uganda intends to improve her national planning process to mitigate short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) by developing a national emission inventory of SLCPs and air pollutants for instance black carbon, methane and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). This will complement Ugandas efforts towards the implementation of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the Ozone layer. Additionally, national appropriate policies and measures to reduce SLCPs will be identified and integrated in the next round of NDCs.

This section highlights the financial support required for implementing the updated NDC actions and measures across all sectors up to 2030 including capacity building and technology development and transfer requirements, and gender equity and transformative actions for ensuring resilience building and low carbon development.

Uganda requires USD 28.1 billion to implement both unconditional and conditional adaptation and mitigation actions and targets of the updated NDC and its cross-cutting issues of technology development and transfer, gender, and capacity building across all sectors up to 2030. The financial support is expected to be mobilized from domestic and international sources.

USD 2.5 billion equivalent to 14% of the total adaptation cost is unconditional and USD 15.2 billion equivalent to 86% is conditional on international support.

The estimated cost of the mitigation policies and measures up to 2030 across all sectors is USD 10.3 billion of which USD 1.6 billion equivalent to 15% of the total mitigation cost is unconditional and USD 8.7 billion equivalent to 85% is conditional on international support. The estimated cost of crosscutting activities including coordination support is USD 0.1 billion.

Capacity building and technology development and transfer are critical for both implementing the interventions in this updated NDC and achieving the Paris Agreement's goals. Recognising the importance of supporting climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and access to information is crucial to the implementation of the updated NDC. Uganda will apply a whole- of -society approach to promote knowledge, awareness raising and information sharing.

The following are some of the capacity building needs to drive implementation of the updated NDC;

Reviewing and implementing the Uganda National Climate Change Learning Strategy.

Building long-term strategic multi stakeholder partnerships.

Strengthening coordination and institutional arrangement to enhance collaboration and promote knowledge sharing.

Establishing climate change knowledge and learning centres.

Expanding access to tools and support for capacity building and awareness raising.  Strengthening monitoring, reporting and verification of the implementation and achievement of the updated NDC.

Technology Development and Transfer.

Uganda has conducted a systematic process for identifying and selecting climate technologies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. A technology action plan for adaptation and for mitigation has been developed but yet to be implemented. For effective implementation of this updated NDC, the following investments are required to accelerate the development and transfer of climate technologies;

Implementing the technology action plans for adaptation and mitigation.

Establishing national and regional demonstration centres of excellence to foster update of climate technologies.

Building community ownership and capacity to operate and management climate technologies.

Building partnership with private sector, research institutions and non-governmental organization to expand co-investment in technology transfer and diffusion.

Creating an enabling environment to address barriers for the development and transfer of climate technologies.

In this updated NDC, a gender analysis was carried out to highlight the different roles of women and men, the challenges they face in light of climate change, and priorities for climate attributed to unequal opportunities on land rights and the exclusion of women from decision- making and thus not benefiting from technologies and practices which enable them better adapt to changing climate conditions.

Under the NDC support program, Uganda has made significant progress on gender and NDC, which includes a draft report for gender analysis for agriculture, energy, and waste; establishing a climate action innovation challenge grant for women and youth-led enterprises; and designating gender focal points for key NDC sectors to support gender integration in their respective institutions planning cycles.

This updated NDC comprises adaptation and mitigation actions that take gender into consideration. To ensure gender-responsive NDC implementation, the following actions should be put in place:

Local Governments to strengthen gender and climate change mainstreaming in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of NDC actions.
