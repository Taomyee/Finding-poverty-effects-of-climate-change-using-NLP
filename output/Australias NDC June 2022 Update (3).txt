I. Australias strengthened climate ambition This submission communicates Australias updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

In this updated NDC, Australia is increasing the ambition of its 2030 target, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Australia also reaffirms its target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Both targets are economy-wide emissions reduction commitments, covering all sectors and gases included in Australias national inventory.

Australias new 2030 target is a significant increase in ambition. It is a 15 percentage point increase on the upper end of the previous 2030 target of 26  28% below 2005 levels  or half as much again as the previous target. The revised 2030 commitment is both a single-year target to reduce emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 and a multi-year emissions budget from 2021-2030.

The updated 2030 target puts Australia on track to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It reflects the Australian Governments resolve to urgently step up action and work alongside global partners to tackle the climate crisis, achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and keep 1.5C within reach. Our aspiration is that the commitments of our industry, states and territories and the Australian people will yield even greater emissions reductions in the coming decade.

Australia will not carry over any overachievement on its 2020 target or its Kyoto Protocol targets to meet its Paris Agreement targets.

The Australian Government is implementing a substantial and rigorous suite of new policies across the economy to drive the transition to net zero. Australias new 2030 target is based on the modelled impact of these policies. The Australian Government is working to urgently implement these policies to maximise their emissions reduction impact and economic benefits and to provide Australian industry with a comprehensive and consistent policy framework. Australias new policies include:

A $20 billion investment in Australias electricity grid to unlock greater penetration of renewable energy and accelerate decarbonisation of the grid.

Complemented by an additional $300 million to deliver community batteries and solar banks across Australia.

Investment of up to $3 billion from the new National Reconstruction Fund to support renewables manufacturing and the deployment of low emissions technologies, broadening Australias industrial base, bolstering regional economic development, and boosting private investment in abatement.

A Powering the Regions Fund to support the development of new clean energy industries and the decarbonisation priorities of existing industry.

The Fund will also prioritise building the workforce skills and capability required for the clean energy transition. The Australian Government will invest a further $100 million to train 10,000 New Energy Apprentices in the jobs of the future and establish a $10 million New Energy Skills Program to provide additional training pathways.

The introduction of declining emissions baselines for Australias major emitters, under the existing Safeguard Mechanism, providing a predictable policy framework for industry, consistent with a national trajectory to net zero and supporting international competitiveness.

Australias first National Electric Vehicle Strategy, to reduce emissions and accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles, including by establishing a new Driving the Nation Fund and doubling the Commonwealths investment in charging and refuelling infrastructure to $500 million. The Australian Government will also introduce an electric car tax discount and establish a real-world emissions testing program to help consumers make more informed choices about the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.

The application of new standardised and internationally-aligned reporting requirements for climate risks and opportunities for large businesses.

A commitment to reduce the emissions of Commonwealth Government agencies to net zero by 2030 (excluding defence and security agencies).

These new measures will build on existing emissions reduction and low emissions technology accelerator policies and programs including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, crediting under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, and a range of investments to accelerate and facilitate low emissions and clean energy technologies, such as green hydrogen, energy storage, and low emissions steel and aluminium, to bring their costs down to make them competitive with higher emitting alternatives.

The Australian Government will introduce a new annual statement to Parliament on climate policy, progress against national targets and international developments and will seek to formalise its targets in legislation. The annual statement and other climate policy will be informed by Australias Climate Change Authority, which the Government will restore as an independent source of advice.

Australia is committed to working closely with our Pacific family to achieve an ambitious international response to the climate crisis, including talking with them about jointly hosting a future UNFCCC Conference of the Parties meeting.

As a federation, Australian States, Territories and local government also implement significant policies and programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support clean energy technologies. Australian households, communities and businesses are increasingly playing their part in addressing climate change and embracing the opportunities presented by the transition to net zero.

The details of Australias new 2030 target, and its 2050 net zero target are provided in Table 1. Australia will track progress towards both targets in its Biennial Transparency Reports under the Paris Agreement, on the basis of national emissions reported in its annual National Inventory Report. Australia will also provide detailed information on each of its policies and measures in its Biennial Transparency Reports.

II. Australias action to advance adaptation and resilience Climate change is already having significant impacts in Australia and our region. The Australian Government is taking concerted action to adapt to climate change and ensure the resilience and disaster readiness of our communities and natural environment in the context of its impacts.

This includes:

Leading the development of an urgent climate risk assessment of the implications of climate change for national security, which will be an enduring feature of Australias climate action.

Making sure Australia is disaster ready by spending up to $200 million every year on disaster preparation and resilience projects.

Protecting Australias unique environment by fixing Australias urban rivers and catchments, and doubling the number of Indigenous Rangers, recognising the importance of employing Indigenous Peoples knowledge and experience to address the climate crisis.

Investing in the health and resilience of our ocean ecosystems, including by strengthening the management of our national network of Marine Parks and spending an additional $194.5 million on top of existing investments to protect the Great Barrier Reef.

Establishing a Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, so that climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as the climate and biodiversity crises, can be addressed holistically.

Australia looks forward to making even stronger contributions to global climate science and sharing our expertise, experiences and skills across the globe toward stronger adaptation and resilience outcomes.

All sectors, categories and carbon pools, as defined by the IPCC 2006 guidelines, and additional sources reported in the annual National Inventory Report.

1.3.3 Complete and continuous coverage Australia has included all categories of anthropogenic emissions or removals in its NDC. No source, sink, or activity that was included in Australias 2020 target under the Convention has been excluded.

1.3.4 Mitigation co-benefits Not applicable.

1.4 Assumptions and methodological approaches for emissions estimates and accounting 1.4.1 Accounting for emissions and removals Australia assesses progress towards its 2030 target by comparing cumulative net emissions over the period 20212030 with the emissions budget for the period.

Australia will account for its 2030 single-year target on the basis of total net national emissions reported in its National Inventory Report for the year 2030, submitted under the Paris Agreement.

Australia will account for its 2050 commitment on the basis of total net national emissions reported in its National Inventory Report for the year 2050, submitted under the Paris Agreement.

Australia will make corresponding adjustments for any internationally transferred mitigation outcomes, consistent with guidance adopted under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, should the Australian Government authorise any for use towards NDCs.

Not applicable.

Australia intends to apply 100 year Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as contained in inventory reporting guidelines, currently IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 100 year GWPs, or as otherwise agreed by the CMA.

The estimates of emissions and removals used in accounting for the NDC will be those reported in the Inventory, which will apply the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, or subsequent version or refinement as agreed by the CMA, and nationally appropriate methods consistent with that guidance and informed inter alia by the IPCC 2019 Refinement and IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement.

1.4.4 Natural disturbances Australia will address emissions and subsequent removals from natural disturbances in accounting for its NDC. The carbon stock changes from natural disturbances are included in the national emissions totals, as described in Australias National Inventory Report (May 2022) consistent with approaches set out in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and the IPCC 2019 Refinement. Australia will continue to provide information on its approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from natural disturbances in its annual National Inventory Report.

1.4.5 Harvested wood products Australia will use a stock-change approach consistent with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines to estimate emissions from Harvested Wood Products, consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and paragraph 56 of the Annex to decision 18/CMA.1. The methodology will be described in detail in Australias annual National Inventory Report.

Not applicable.

1.4.7 Other assumptions and methodological approaches used including:

The emissions budget for the 2030 target is calculated using a straight-line trajectory which takes a linear decrease from 2020 to 2030. This trajectory begins from Australias 2020 target (5% below 2000 levels), and finishes at 43% below 2005 levels in 2030. The area under the trajectory for the period 20212030 is the emissions budget for the 2030 target.

The reference indicator for the 2030 single-year target is net national greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2005, as published in the National Inventory Report annually. The definitions, data sources and models used to estimate net emissions are those described in the National Inventory Report.

The reference indicator for the 2050 commitment is net national greenhouse gas emissions in the most recently available year, as published in the National Inventory Report annually. The definitions, data sources and models used to estimate net emissions are those described in the National Inventory Report.

1.4.8 Non greenhouse-gas components Not applicable.

1.4.9 Climate forcers, as applicable Not applicable.

Not applicable.

1.4.11 Intended use of voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement Should Australia decide to use cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement towards achievement of its NDC or to authorize the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards the NDCs of other Parties, it would report on such use or authorization through its Biennial Transparency Reports and consistent with guidance adopted under Article 6.

Table 2: Fair and Ambitious Contribution, Contribution to Article 2, Planning Processes Information and Article 4. 2.1 How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 2.1.1 A fair and ambitious contribution Australias updated Nationally Determined Contribution represents a significant increase in Australias ambition and reflects a strong commitment to urgent ambitious action on climate change.

Australias enhanced NDC is underpinned by a robust policy framework that will deliver on our emissions reduction commitments while driving economic growth, making electricity more affordable and creating new jobs. Australia is implementing a substantial and rigorous suite of new policies that will drive the uptake of existing technology, encourage innovation in existing industries and invest in the technology and industries of the future to achieve our 2030 target and support Australias transition to net zero.

Australias plan to achieve its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets has the wellbeing and prosperity of all Australians, including regional communities, at its core. It recognises the global transition to a clean energy economy is underway, creating impacts and opportunities for Australias industries. The Australian Government will support and partner with communities and industry on decarbonisation priorities, the development of new clean energy industries and skills and training programs to support workforce development. This will ensure that Australia is well-positioned to capitalise on clean economy opportunities to drive growth and support job creation.

The Australian Government has committed to reduce the emissions of Commonwealth Government agencies to net zero emissions by 2030 (excluding defence and security agencies). Emissions reductions across non-Defence (Australian Public Service) agencies is a strong commitment to lead by example on emissions reductions and contribute to the decarbonisation of Australias economy.

The Australian Government will also improve integrity in decision-making around climate change with a new annual statement to Parliament as a matter of transparency and accountability. This will report on climate policy and progress towards national targets. The Government will also restore the role of Australias Climate Change Authority as an independent source of advice.

Australias updated NDC is a progression on our previous 2030 target and a significant increase in ambition, committing Australia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030  half as much again as the previous target of 26  28%  and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Australias 2030 and 2050 targets are economy-wide absolute emissions reduction targets.

Not applicable.

2.2 How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2: 2.2.1 How the NDC contributes Achievement of Australias 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets will contribute towards stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Both targets will also be achieved in a manner which will ensure economic growth and will be complemented by measures to advance adaptation, ensure security of food production and to enable sustainable economic development.

2.2.2 How the NDC contributes towards the Paris Agreements temperature and mitigation goals Achievement of Australias 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets will contribute towards holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.

The Australian Government is implementing a series of new policies across the economy to support the uptake of existing technology, encourage innovation in existing industries and invest in the technology and industries of the future. These measures will support the achievement of the 2030 target and put Australia on the path to net zero emissions by 2050.

Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender- responsive manner The Commonwealth Government of Australia is responsible for policy making at the national level.

The Australian Government will improve integrity in decision-making around climate change through annual statements to Parliament on climate policy, including progress against national targets, and by restoring Australias Climate Change Authority. This will provide transparency and ensure accountability on climate action.

The Australian Government is implementing a broad suite of new policies across the economy to drive the transition to a net zero economy, and is improving and strengthening existing policies.

The Australian Government will build on the 2019 King Review, by undertaking a review into Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) to ensure their integrity and consistency with agricultural and other objectives, and contribution to environmental, economic and other benefits like biodiversity. The Australian Government will also improve the Safeguard Mechanism by introducing mandatory emissions baselines for facilities already covered by the Mechanism over time. This will align policy with recommendations from the private sector and will provide a supportive policy framework that will encourage industry investment in low emissions technologies.

Australia provides information on its climate change policies and measures in each Biennial Report and National Communication and will continue to provide updated information through each Biennial Transparency Report.

2.3.2 Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate:

National circumstances, such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development and poverty eradication Australias unique national circumstances shape its response to climate change. Australias system of government, vast size, diverse landscapes, predisposition to climate variability, resource-based economy and small but growing population living mostly in coastal regions pose challenges and opportunities to managing the impacts of climate change.

Australia operates under a federal system of government in which legislative powers are distributed between the Commonwealth, the six states and two territories. Under this system, the Commonwealth Government of Australia is responsible for policy making at the national level. National targets and federal emissions reductions policies are complemented by targets and measures implemented at the State and Territory level, which make a leading contribution to the decarbonisation of Australias economy.

Climate change holds serious ramifications for all Australians, playing a part in extreme weather events and their intensity and frequency. The Australian Governments policy measures recognise these impacts and provide the framework to support Australians on the pathway to net zero transition. These policies will accelerate decarbonisation of industry and support the development of new clean energy industries through investment to drive renewables manufacturing and the deployment of low emissions technologies.

Australia is transforming its electricity market, from an electricity grid dominated by large scale, fossil fuel-fired generators to a grid with increasing penetration of renewables, storage and demand management technologies.

Australias NDC follows the rules for transparency and understanding set out in decision 4/CMA.1. A range of Commonwealth Government agencies were involved in the development of the NDC, reflecting shared policy responsibility.
